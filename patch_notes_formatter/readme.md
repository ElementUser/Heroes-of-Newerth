# Patch Notes Formatter for HoN

Requires Python 3 or higher. The program can be ran via the host computer's OS terminal by typing in "py patchNotesFormatter.py".

- Running patchNotesFormatter.py requires a patch_notes.txt file. Doing so will output a `game_output.txt` file
- These files contain the patch notes formatted specifically for the in-game patch noteses
- Additional strings in the subheaders & ability name lists may need to be defined, since those are not obtained dynamically through an external source.
