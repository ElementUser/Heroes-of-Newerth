Version 4.10.1
----------------
18 January 2022



== Design ==

- Reverted Christmas themed music, map, cosmetics, and in-game Heads-Up Display (HUD) back to their default variants.



= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Arachna

Spider Sting
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Cooldown reduced from 70/50/30 seconds to 30/25/20 seconds (was previously reduced from 70/50/30 seconds to 35/25/15 seconds).

_______________________________________________

Deadlift

Unholy Strength
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Cooldown is now reduced by 1.5 seconds (was previously reduced by 2 seconds).
*Strength stolen increased from 4 Strength to 8 Strength (was previously increased from 4 Strength to 10 Strength).

+ Deadlift's Unholy Strength was a little too strong and frustrating to deal with when boosted by Staff of the Master. This change should alleviate some of those issues while retaining Staff of the Master's viability on Deadlift.

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master

Drink
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Max charges increased by 10.

3 Point Strike
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Time to reset all activated strike points for a target (after the effect of 3 Point Strike has been triggered already) reduced from 12 seconds to 4 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Master of Arms

Staff of the Master effect additions (to pre-existing):
- Combining Bulldozer and Cheetah together has imperfections during Master's Call, causing the bonuses to drop to 70% of their original values.
*Attack Speed bonus reduced from 100/150/200 to 70/105/140.
*Attack Damage bonus reduced from 40/50/60 to 28/35/42.

+ Master of Arms' Staff of the Master effect was poorly designed and far too powerful, to the point where it was deemed necessary to pick up as his first core item.
+ A large part of the poor design stemmed from gaining the full effects from both Bulldozer and Cheetah for an abnormally long duration.
+ When combined with the other changes to Master of Arms, Staff of the Master is less of a "mandatory" item to get for him.

_______________________________________________



= General =

Kongor Boss Enchantment - Speed
- Bonus Movement Speed per charge increased from 8 to 10.

+ This enchantment was barely picked up after its nerfs and after the Vitality Enchantment was introduced.



= Heroes =

Adrenaline
- Starting Attack Damage increased from 43-53 to 51-57.

+ Adrenaline's starting Attack Damage was drastically lower than the average Strength Hero's starting Attack Damage.
+ This change should compensate for some of the other following changes to Adrenaline.

Shard Blast
- Base Magic Damage reduced from 80/115/150/185 to 75/110/145/180.
- Duration for maintaining charges on Shard Blast (after hitting 2+ enemy heroes) reduced from 10 seconds to 7 seconds.

Rush
- Range reduced from 575/650/725/800 to 530/570/610/650.
- Movement Speed bonus when dashing through an enemy hero reduced from 16/24/32/40% to 10/12/14/16%.
- Movement Speed bonus from Rush can now stack up to 2 times (max of 20/24/28/32% Movement Speed).

+ The changes to Rush makes it less effective when used as an escape mechanism.

Ember Shard
- Max pull distance reduced from 800 to 700.
- Pull speed reduced from 1600 to 1400 units per second.
*There is no overall change in the max amount of time in which affected enemies are pulled (they are stunned while being pulled).
- Leash distance reduced from 750 to 650.

+ The changes to Ember Shard can be considered a minor buff, as you can proc the effects of Ember Shard more reliably without the need to use Rush.

Death's Halo
- Max duration reduced from 5/6/7 seconds to 4/4.5/5 seconds.
- Bonuses are now capped at 7 charges (i.e., 3 enemy heroes and yourself).
- Magic Armor per charge reduced from 1.5 to 1.
- Strength per charge reduced from 4/5/6 to 3/4/5.

+ The changes to Death's Halo slightly reduces its efficacy for Adrenaline's survivability when fighting multiple heroes, which should make Adrenaline slightly easier to deal with while Death's Halo is active.
+ Adrenaline was far too powerful in the hands of players skilled with him, while having relatively poor performance in the average game. These changes should address both issues and put Adrenaline in a healthy position across all skill brackets, performance-wise.

_______________________________________________

Amun-Ra

Path of Destruction
- While on the path, Amun-Ra now also gains 80 Max Movement Speed.
- While on the path, Movement Speed bonus increased from 300 to 380.
- Meteor projectile travel time reduced from 0.5 seconds to 0.4 seconds.
- Meteor impact delay reduced from 0.5 seconds to 0.4 seconds.
*Total delay for impact after casting the ability reduced from 1 second to 0.8 seconds.
- Now also passively grants 0.7/1.4/2.1/2.8 Health Regeneration per second.

Ignite
- Now also passively grants 0.7/1.4/2.1/2.8 Health Regeneration per second.

Ashes to Ashes
- Passive Health Regeneration per second reduced from 2/3/4/5 to 0.7/1.4/2.1/2.8.
- Non-hero enemy units now take 25% less damage from this ability.
- Amun-Ra now also gains 0.4 Attack Speed per charge from this ability (max of 8/12/16/20 bonus Attack Speed).
- Requires Hero Level 3 or higher to deal Magic Damage to neutral creeps.

+ Amun-Ra now has better performance against enemy heroes (in general and in the laning phase) and is no longer a viable jungler.
+ Path of Destruction's overall delay has been reduced by 20%, which should increase its accuracy just enough to be more of a reliable skill to use in combat.
+ Overall, every ability now grants a small amount of Amun-Ra Health Regeneration, which allows for variations in his skill build without needing to max out Ashes to Ashes first.

_______________________________________________

Arachna
- Attack Range increased from 550 to 575.

Webbed Shot
- Mana Cost reduced from 20 to 15.

Spider Sting
- Max Health of the Spiderling increased from 4/5/6 to 5/6/7.

+ Arachna's lane dominance has been partially reinforced with these small changes, as the hero tapers off due to its lack of a farming tool.

_______________________________________________

Calamity

Dragon's Path
- Magic Damage per hit increased from 20/45/65/90 to 25/50/70/95.

_______________________________________________

Chipper

Focus Buffer
- Max Shield Health for Magic Damage reduced from 125/250/375/500 to 125/225/325/425.

_______________________________________________

Chronos
- Strength growth per level increased from 1.4 to 1.5.

_______________________________________________

Circe

Doppelganger
- Illusion lifetime reduced from 15/20/25/30 seconds to 14/16/18/20 seconds.
- Cooldown increased from 11 seconds to 18/16/14/12 seconds.

+ Circe's illusions were frustrating to deal with at higher levels of play. The overall uptime of the illusions have been reduced to address this issue.

Twisted Visage
- Cooldown reduced from 100/80/60 seconds to 90/75/60 seconds.
- Mana Cost reduced from 100/150/200 to 100/130/160.

+ In exchange, Circe gets slightly better availability on her most fun ability, Twisted Visage.

_______________________________________________

Deadlift

Unholy Strength
- Max amount of Strength stolen reduced from 100 to 80.

_______________________________________________

Doctor Repulsor

Ludicrous Speed
- Cooldown increased from 0.5 seconds to 1.2/0.85/0.5 seconds.

+ This change should make Doctor Repulsor noticeably more vulnerable and have slightly less sustained damage in the early to mid game, without affecting his primary combos at those phases of the game.

_______________________________________________

Electrician
- Intelligence gain per level increased from 1.5 to 1.8.

_______________________________________________

Emerald Warden

Hunter's Command
- Damage multiplier when hitting enemy heroes that you do not have vision of increased from 0.5x to 0.75x.

_______________________________________________

Empath
- Base Agility reduced from 20 to 18.

_______________________________________________

Flux
- Base Intelligence increased from 16 to 18.

_______________________________________________

Glacius
- Strength growth per level increased from 1.5 to 1.6.
- Agility growth per level increased from 1.5 to 1.6.
- Base Movement Speed increased from 285 to 290.

Tundra Blast
- Cooldown reduced from 15 seconds to 15/14/13/12 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Magebane
- Strength gain per level reduced from 2.6 to 2.5.
- Base Strength reduced from 22 to 21.

Flash of Anti-Magic
- Mana Cost increased from 60 to 65.
- Magic Damage Shield Health reduced from 40/70/100/130 to 30/55/80/105.
- Magic Damage reduced from 40/70/100/130 to 30/55/80/105.
- Magic Damage to enemies in the area now only triggers if the shield breaks from receiving Magic Damage (instead of being applied upon reaching your target destination).
*This Magic Damage instance will not be triggered if the shield expires normally (i.e., when its state lifetime expires).
- Movement Speed Slow reduced from 20/25/30/35% to 15/20/25/30%.
- Radius reduced from 400 units to 350 units.

Master of the Mantra
- Attack Speed bonus granted to Magebane when attacking an enemy hero reduced from 20/30/40/50 to 16/24/32/40.

Mana Rift
- Cooldown increased from 100/85/70 seconds to 105/90/75 seconds.

+ Magebane is powerful in lane and is deliberately intended to be that way to retain his threat level against mages at the point where they are the most powerful.
+ However, his early game power has been toned down a bit for his opponents to have more reasonable timings regarding counterplay.
+ Most notably, he has lost a large amount of last-hit power and extra harass damage (as well as a bit of overall farm speed in mid-game) through the nerfs on Flash of Anti-Magic, as the anti-magic shield must be broken for it to deal damage around him.

_______________________________________________

Master of Arms
- Base Intelligence increased from 14 to 16.

Weapon Enhancement
- Bulldozer: Attack Range bonus rescaled from 150 to 90/105/120/135/150.

Master's Call
- Cast action time reduced from 0.2 seconds to 0.1 seconds.
- Buff duration for the Attack Speed/Attack Damage bonus on self reduced from 25 seconds to 14 seconds.
- Now also grants Master of Arms 60/90/120 tapering bonus Movement Speed for the first 6 seconds.

+ Master of Arms will now have better overall performance in the mid-game and late-game without Staff of the Master, while having slightly less Attack Range with his Bulldozer gun in the early game.
+ The ridiculously high buff duration of Master's Call has also been reduced to a reasonable duration.

_______________________________________________

Ophelia

Command
- Creeps affected by Command now also gain 0.5/1/1.5/2 Mana Regeneration per second and 25/50/75/100 Max Mana.

+ This change will allow Ophelia players to not always have to pick up Ring of Sorcery in every single game, allowing her more potential build options.
+ Note that Ophelia can passively boost the Mana Regeneration of her creeps even further with auras like Ring of the Teacher, or by dominating Catman Champion to make use of its Mana Regeneration aura.

_______________________________________________

Prophet

Debilitate
- Tapering Movement Speed Slow magnitude reduced from 30% to 20%.

_______________________________________________

Puppet Master

Voodoo Puppet
- After becoming unkillable, increased Voodoo Puppet's lifetime from 1.5/2/2.5 seconds to 1.5/2.25/3 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Sand Wraith

Mirage
- Cooldown increased from 125/115/105 seconds to 130/120/110 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Silhouette
- Base Strength increased from 15 to 16.

_______________________________________________

Thunderbringer

Blast of Lightning
- Reveal effect from this ability: reveal radius that reveals enemy Wards now only has a radius of 450 units (from 900 units).
*Still grants vision in a large area and reveals other stealthed enemy units.

Lightning Storm
- Reveal effect from this ability no longer reveals enemy Wards.
*Still grants vision in a large area and reveals other stealthed enemy units.

+ Thunderbringer's counterwarding utility yielded too high of a reward for little to no risk.
+ Reducing the radius drastically increases the precision requirements if the player wishes to counterward.
+ Overall, significantly more time will have to be spent to check a larger area for wards with Blast of Lightning, should the player wish to be thorough.

_______________________________________________

Torturer

Agonizing Bonds
- Magic Damage changed from 65/130/195/260 to 80/140/200/260.

Torment
- Using a non-ultimate ability grants Torturer 4/7/10 Health Regeneration per second for 4 seconds.
*This effect does not stack additively, but using non-ultimate abilities will refresh the duration of the Health Regeneration bonus.

+ Torturer does not have any form of sustain built into his kit. Leveling Torment will now grant him a tiny bit of Health Sustain to help with this issue.

_______________________________________________

Tremble

Terrorform
- Terror Mound's level 3 cast range increased from 5000 units to 7000 units.

_______________________________________________

Voodoo Jester
- Starting Attack Damage changed from 51-61 to 51-59.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

= Wingbow-related Changes =

Faux Bow
- Recipe cost reduced from 550 Gold to 250 Gold.
*Total cost reduced from 2200 Gold to 1900 Gold.
*Note that this reduces Wingbow's total cost by 300 Gold as well.
- Now grants Melee heroes 50 Attack Range.

Savage Mace
- Chance to gain True Strike reduced from 100% to 80%.
*Chance to proc other effects remain unchanged, at 40%.

Wingbow
- Agility bonus increased from 32 to 33.
- Melee heroes now also gain an additional 5 Agility (for a total of 38 Agility) and 75 Attack Range.
*Total Cost reduced from 6200 Gold to 5900 Gold, based on Faux Bow's cost change.

+ These changes make Wingbow more viable on melee heroes, and retains some usefulness of bonus Evasion even against Savage Mace.



= Other Item Changes =

Codex
- Magic Damage for level 1 Codex increased from 330 to 350.

+ Heroes that commonly pick up this item are at a much more balanced performance now due to changes made for those heroes. As a result, Codex's level 1 damage value can be reverted.

Genjuro
- Attack Damage bonus reduced from 35 to 30.
- Attack Speed bonus reduced from 20 to 10.

+ Genjuro was already giving a lot of value through its upgraded active ability from Assassin's Shroud. Some of its "free" stat bonuses have been toned down slightly because of this.
+ Its pickup rate should now be more comparable to that of Wingbow.

Ghost Marchers
- State duration for the bonus Movement Speed increased from 3 seconds to 3.5 seconds.

Helm of the Black Legion
- Max Health bonus reduced from 270 to 250.
- Block chance reduced from 60% to 50%.

Ultor's Heavy Helm
- Max Health bonus reduced from 300 to 275.
- Block amount reduced from 80 to 70 (if the wielder of the item is a melee hero).

+ Ultor's Heavy Helm's was a little too effective after its previous buffs, so its block amount and Max Health bonus have been slightly reduced.





== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

= General =

The following sources of Armor Reduction and Magic Armor Reduction will no longer apply to boss units:
- Blacksmith's Flaming Hammer
- Hellbringer's Evil Presence
- Myrmidon's Wave Form
- King Klout's Conscription
- Revenant's Mortification
- Tremble's Impalers (and the controllable Shudder's Impalers)
- Armor of the Mad Mage
- Harkon's Blade
- Shieldbreaker



= Heroes =

Amun-Ra
- Ignite now deals the proper amount of damage upon respawning from Pyroclasmic Rebirth.

Blood Hunter
- Reduced the volume of Hemorrhage's initial hissing sound.

Bubbles
- Take Cover will no longer trigger when Bubbles damages himself (e.g., with Blood Chalice).

Ellonia
- Absolute Zero's trail visual effect is now correct for the Frostshard Ellonia avatar.

Goldenveil
- Stun state from Plunge is now correctly treated as a Status Disable (instead of a Status Debuff) to be consistent with other stun states.

Magebane
- Mana Combustion now properly displays its visual mana trail effects when burning an enemy unit's mana (similar to Nullfire Blade's visual effects, but with thinner mana trails).

Myrmidon
- Wave Form's detrimental states applied to enemy units are now properly treated as Status Debuffs.



= Items =

Insanitarius
- Now toggles off automatically upon death. This resolves a health quantity issue when interacting with Amun-Ra's Pyroclasmic Rebirth and Token of Life.

Plated Greaves
- Activation will no longer interrupt channeling for self.

Version 4.10.0.1
----------------
16 December 2021



== Design ==



= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Soulstealer

Soulsteal
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Cast Speed bonus is now 50 (instead of 70).
*Max number of souls is now 20/30/40/50 (instead of 25/35/45/55).

+ Soulstealer was doing a little too much damage with Soul Burst while having Staff of the Master, with not enough room for reasonable counterplay.
+ Reducing the max damage dealt by Soul Burst with Staff of the Master through Soulsteal and slightly reducing the Cast Speed bonus will ease these issues, while still making Staff of the Master be a strong pickup/boost on Soulstealer.

_______________________________________________



= Heroes =

Fayde

Burning Shadows
- Stun duration reduced from 1.6/2/2.4/2.8 seconds to 1.6/1.9/2.2/2.5 seconds.

Reflection
- Magic Damage dealt based on the target's current Health reduced from 10/17/24% to 10/15/20%.

_______________________________________________

Magebane
- Base Strength increased from 21 to 22.
- Strength growth per level increased from 2.4 to 2.6.
- Base Agility increased from 16 to 18.
- Agility growth per level increased from 1.4 to 1.6.
- Base Intelligence increased from 16 to 18.
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.5 to 2.
- Base Armor increased from 1.8 to 2.5.

Flash of Anti-Magic
- Cooldown reduced from 12 seconds to 10 seconds.
- Cast Range increased from 500/600/700/800 to 600/700/800/900.
- Mana cost reduced from 75/70/65/60 to 60.
- Damage changed from 30/60/90/120 Physical Damage to 40/70/100/130 Magic Damage.
- Magic Damage Shield health increased from 30/60/90/120 to 40/70/100/130.
- Radius increased from 350 units to 400 units.
- Movement Speed Slow increased from 15/20/25/30% to 20/25/30/35%.
- Movement Speed Slow duration increased from 2 seconds to 2.5 seconds.
- Now also triggers the Attack Speed and ally Magic Damage Reduction effects of Master of the Mantra (if it is leveled) if an enemy hero is within the destination's radius of this ability.

Master of the Mantra
- Now only requires 1 attack against enemy heroes to grant Magebane all of its passive benefits (Attack Speed and ally Magic Damage Resistance), instead of 2/3/4/5 attacks.
- Mana Cost for the active ability reduced from 65/80/95/110 to 45/60/75/90.
- Mana Flare and Master of the Mantra aura radius increased from 900 units to 1200 units.

Mana Rift
- Magic Damage increased from 80/110/140% to 90/120/150% of the main target's missing Mana.

+ Magebane felt a little sluggish and underwhelming at a few specific phases of the game.
+ Through some mechanical changes and number changes, these areas have been smoothened out. Magebane should now be able to do what he is intended to do at each phase of the game, while still ensuring his late-game has reasonable counterplay.
+ All of Magebane's abilities are now pseudo-1-point-wonders, and it is actually optimal to max Master of the Mantra first in most situations.
+ The player still has full flexibility on which ability to max first, though it is strongly suggested to have at least 1 point in each of his non-ultimate abilities by level 4.

_______________________________________________

Nitro
- Starting Attack Damage reduced from 46-53 to 45-50.

Overdrive
- Initial Attack Speed bonus reduced from 200 to 100.

_______________________________________________

Pandamonium

Face Smash
- Cast Range increased from 100 to 150.

_______________________________________________

Parallax

- Strength gain per level reduced from 1.9 to 1.7.

_______________________________________________

Sapphire

Quickshield
- Attack Speed bonus reduced from 20/35/50/65 to 15/30/45/60.
- After the shield health reaches 0, the persisting Attack Speed buff is halved.

_______________________________________________

Wildsoul

Bear Form
- Mana Cost for toggling the ability on reduced from 20 to 5.

_______________________________________________



== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

= General =

User Interface ("New"):
- Mid Wars mode selection menu now shows 3 options by default (instead of 2), thus no longer requiring the user to hover over the mode selection menu to view all 3 game options.

The following sources of stun states can no longer have their duration reduced by Stun Duration Reduction sources:
- Andromeda's Void Rip
- Chipper's Rocket Barrage
- Flint Beastwood's Hollowpoint Shells
- Flint Beastwood's Money Shot
- Glacius' Ice Imprisonment
- Swiftblade's Swift Slashes
- Pharaoh's Hellfire
- Plague Rider's Plague Carrier
- Savage Mace
*These changes allow these stun sources to cancel channels on enemy heroes (e.g. Homecoming Stone) in the niche scenarios if they have enouigh Stun Duration Reduction from various sources (e.g. Shaman's Headdress, Barrier Idol, etc.).
*Note that this list isn't all-inclusive, and more may be added to this patch & future patches without being listed, as these types of changes do not impact gameplay other than the niche scenarios mentioned above.



= Heroes =

Bombardier
- Using Sticky Bomb's second activation will no longer interrupt Bombardier's current orders.

Gunblade
- Lethal Range now uses Gunblade's correct Attack Range for its range-based calculations when Faux Bow or Wingbow are in his inventory.

Moira
- Ephemeral Forge's lifetime will no longer be temporarily frozen by Arcane Vortex.
*This prevents a lifetime and channel time desync bug with Ephemeral Forge.

Kinesis
- Telekinetic Control now interacts properly with spell block sources (e.g. Null Stone) and ability cast detection sources (e.g. Mana Battery) for all alternate avatars.

== Design ==



= Hero Reworks =

Magebane (Reworked)
- Primary attribute changed from Agility to Strength.
- Base Strength increased from 16 to 21.
*Starting Attack Damage remains the same (48-52).
- Strength growth increased from 1.8 to 2.4.
- Agility growth reduced from 3.1 to 1.4.
- Base Agility reduced from 25 to 16.
- Base Intelligence increased from 15 to 17.
- Intelligence gain per level increased from 1 to 1.5.
- Base Attack Time increased from 1.45 to 1.6.
- Base Movement Speed reduced from 315 to 310.
- Starting Armor increased from 1.5 to 1.8.
- Model size increased by 15%.

Mana Combustion
- Now applies 0.33x of its effects if the target is Magic Immune.

Flash of Anti-Magic (Reworked)
*Range: 500/600/700/800
*Mana Cost: 75/70/65/60
*Radius: 350
*Cooldown: 12 seconds

- Target a location to teleport there, applying a 15/20/25/30% Movement Speed Slow for 2 seconds to enemy units within radius and dealing 30/60/90/120 Physical Damage to them.
- If an enemy hero is within radius, the cooldown of this ability is reduced by 4 seconds, and you gain a 30/60/90/120 post-damage-mitigation shield that absorbs 50% of incoming Magic Damage for 7 seconds.

+ These changes allows Magebane to be mobile in offensive scenarios if he is actively engaging with his foes, while reducing the frequency of using Flash outside of actual combat.
+ These changes also take the focus off of Magebane's flash-farming capabilities and encourages him to participate in teamfights and ganks early on.
+ Although the listed shield values are low, it is deceptively strong against Magic Damage in actual combat, due to how it stacks with Magic Armor and Master of the Mantra's Magic Damage reduction.

Ability 3: Master of the Mantra (Reworked)
- Passively grants Magebane 10/15/20/25% Magic Damage Reduction.
- Attacking an enemy hero adds 1 charge to this ability for 7 seconds. Max of 2/3/4/5 charges.
- Each charge grants 10 Attack Speed to Magebane, and grants 3% Magic Damage reduction to other ally player-controlled units within 900 radius.
*Note that the Magic Damage reduction from this ability stacks multiplicatively with other sources of Magic Damage mitigation, like Magic Armor.

- Activate to apply Mantra of Anti-Magic on Magebane for 10 seconds. While active, fires a Mana Flare at an enemy hero if they use an ability within 900 radius of Magebane, dealing Magic Damage equal to 30/50/70/90% of an ability's Mana Cost to them.
*This effect now has appropriate visual effects to indicate that a player took damage from this ability. In the past, this ability had no visual feedback, which resulted in nobody noticing how effective this effect was or when you actually took damage from this effect.
*Mana Cost: 65/80/95/110
*Cooldown: 35 seconds


Mana Rift
- Magic Damage reduced from 100/130/160% to 80/110/140% of the main target's missing Mana.
- Mana Cost reduced from 120/200/275 to 100/160/220.
- Cooldown changed from 120/100/80 seconds to 100/85/70 seconds.

+ Magebane's design has been flawed from its conception, even from its WC3 DotA days. He had a contradictory role of being a flash-farmer and fragile early-game carry. In the late game, he has ridiculous amounts of mobility and high damage reduction against both Physical Damage (due to his former Agility primary attribute) and against Magic Damage, and did not actually counter mages at their strongest phase (early game). His playstyle was also generally linear for optimal play, as he had to farm Runed Cleaver and flashfarm to have any hopes of winning the game. This led to high levels of frustration for your ally team (because he is typically useless in the early to mid game and causes your team to fight 4v5 early on) and for the enemy team (late-game when reaching critical mass, there is no realistic counterplay to him because he has too much mobility, overall survivability, and insane damage output with high split push power).
+ In fact, Magebane's analog (Anti-Mage) is one of the most frustrating heroes to play against and play with on your team in Dota 2.


+ After shifting Magebane's primary attribute to Strength and reworking 2 of his abilities, he has now become a vanguard/frontliner for his team against Magic Damage and giving him some actual presence in the early to mid game (at the expense of having a weaker late-game scaling).
+ Master of the Mantra's changes in the Magic Damage mitigation mechanics allows Magebane to properly protect against Magic Damage and Spellshards' Magic Armor Penetration effect, as well as purchase Magic Armor for himself if he requires even more protection from Magic Damage.
+ Magebane is encouraged to be proactive to benefit his team due to how Master of the Mantra gains charges. Pair Magebane up with another initiator and your team will have great protection against Magic Damage if your opponents choose to engage!
+ In the laning phase, you can actually use Flash and Mana Combustion to effectively harass enemy laners and trade efficiently, unlike before where you risk dying.
+ Magebane is intended to be drafted against teams with heavy bursts of Magic Damage. He punishes enemy heroes with high Max Mana and cast spells with high Mana Costs.
+ It should now be less frustrating to deal with Magebane, as he has now been given a weakness in the form of low Armor. His Flash has overall lower range and only has a low cooldown if you use it offensively, so chasing Magebane will also be much easier compared to before.

+ Overall, Magebane's design flaws and frustrations have been resolved for all players, he's still fun to play, and he has a good level of contribution to the team for all phases of the game.
+ The overall feel when playing the hero remains largely the same, but his overall playstyle has been changed.

= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Staff of the Master visual effects were added for the following heroes:
- Kraken
- Rampage
- Soulstealer

+ Credits go to Whyzozerious for creating the visual effects!

_______________________________________________

Artesia

Essence Projection
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Check radius for an enemy Well (for cooldown adjustment purposes) increased from 1600 units to 2200 units.
*Cooldown is now reduced to 60 seconds (was previously 50 seconds).

_______________________________________________

Blacksmith

Chaotic Flames
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Mana Cost increased from 20% Max Mana to 30% Max Mana.
*Fireball and Frenzy, when triggered by the passive autoattack portion of this ability, can no longer multicast.
*Mana spent on this ability no longer triggers effects that occur when mana is spent (e.g., Nome's Wisdom).

_______________________________________________

Moraxus

Matraxe
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Internal cooldown for throwing an axe when attacking an enemy reduced from 1 second to 0.8 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Rampage

Stampede
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*While active, Stampede also grants Magic Immunity.
*Stampede's cooldown refreshes upon getting a hero kill or assist.

Horned Strike
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Cooldown reduced to 3.5 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Soulstealer

Soulsteal
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Now passively grants Soulstealer +70 Cast Speed.

_______________________________________________



= Forests of Caldavar =

- Tower Bounty for the killer changed from 460/510/560/610 to 380/460/560/610.
- Tower Bounty for other teammates changed from 150/200/300/350 to 200/250/300/350.
*Total Gold given across the team changed from 1060/1310/1760/2010 to 1180/1460/1760/2010.
- Tower Bounty consolation for pllayers on the team of the killer (when the Legion/Hellbourne faction gets the kill) changed from 265 to 285 for level 1 Towers.
*Total Gold given across the team in this manner increased from 1325 to 1425 for level 1 Towers.

+ These changes reduce the gold bounty difference between the solo killer and their teammates, and generally increase the overall amount of gold a team gains when killing a tower.
+ Credits to w3wstarboy for the suggestion!



= Mid Wars =

- Rune spawn location has been moved to be more equidistant between the Legion-side cliff and the Hellbourne-side cliff.



= Structures =

Towers
- Armor Penetration changed from 25% to 20%/35%/50%.

Well/Tarpit
- Attack Range increased from 800 to 1000.
- Attack Damage reduced from 200 to 175.
- Attacks now have 50% Armor Penetration.

Store at the Main Base
- Radius in which you can purchase items increased from 500 to 600.

+ Towers and the Well/Tarpit attack structures are now a little more lethal to enemies as they gain Armor.
+ In general, the Well/Tarpit lacked a little bit of attack range. Players should now feel slightly safer within their Well/Tarpit area.
+ The store item purchase radius was not covering the staircase to the well, so this small quality-of-life change should make purchasing items at the base more consistent.



= General =

Camera Distance
- The in-game default and max camera distances (i.e., zoom level) have been increased by approximately 7%.

Kongor Boss Enchantment - Stats
- Renamed to "Kongor Boss Enchantment - Vitality"
- Grants a bonus 100 Max Health per charge.
- Grants a bonus 50 Max Mana per charge.
- Grants a bonus 2% Healing Received per charge.
- Grants 2 Health Regeneration (per second) per charge.
- Grants 0.6 Mana Regeneration (per second) per charge.

Kongor Boss Enchantment - Speed
- Bonus Movement Speed per charge reduced from 12 to 8.

+ For the Kongor permanent buff rewards, nobody took the stats bonus and almost everyone took the Speed bonus (because most sources of Movement Speed from items do not stack).
+ To resolve these issues and also introduce more survivability options in the game, the stat bonus was changed to a vitality-based bonus (as the stat bonus was chosen for the +4 Strength bonus anyway, which translated to 76 Max Health).
+ The Vitality boss enchantment allows for an option to increase your hero's survivability and helps with Health and Mana sustain.

Lane Creeps
- Ranged lane creeps (including ranged siege creeps) will now have True Strike when attacking enemy lane creeps.

+ This change was done to improve the consistency of last-hitting creeps, particularly in the laning phase in middle lane when ranged creeps are attacking uphill.

Single Draft
- Picking phase duration increased from 60 seconds to 70 seconds.



= Heroes =

Adrenaline

Shard Blast
- Bonus Magic Damage dealt based on your primary attribute increased from 20/30/40/50% to 30/40/50/60%.
- Touch radius increased from 80 to 100.

_______________________________________________

Aluna

Emerald Lightning
- Attack Speed steal increased from 20/30/40/50 to 30/40/50/60.

_______________________________________________

Artesia

Magic Missile
- Healing Mode: healing amount increased from 40/50/60/70 to 40/50/65/80.

Essence Projection
- When the projection is damaged, cooldown for repositioning the projection increased from 2 seconds to 3 seconds.

+ Artesia's healing is now more potent for prolonged teamfights when Magic Missile's level is maxed.

_______________________________________________

Blacksmith
- Strength growth per level reduced from 3.2 to 3.

_______________________________________________

Blitz
- Attack Range reduced from 475 to 450.

+ Blitz has been surging in performance since the general attack range adjustments across most ranged heroes. His attack range has been further reduced to put him in line with other ganker-support heroes.

_______________________________________________

Bombardier

Boom Dust
- Magic Damage per proc increased from 15/25/35/45 to 20/30/40/50.

_______________________________________________

Bramble

Chomp!
- Bonus Magic Damage dealt to enemy units is now capped at 300.

Entangling Vine Wall
- No longer applies Restrain to enemies when the Vine Walls attack.
*Vine Walls will still apply the Movement Speed Slow upon attacking.
- Upon spawning, the Vine Walls will apply the Movement Speed Slow and Restrain to enemies within 300 radius of them for 2.5 seconds.

+ The change to Chomp! is more tailored towards keeping Bramble within a reasonable limit for modes like Mid Wars, where stacks are prevalent and are more problematic than that of other linear scaling permanent buff mechanics.
+ Otherwise, the restrain on Bramble's Entangling Vine Wall was made much less oppressive & does not let Bramble lock down mobile heroes for a long period of time.

_______________________________________________

Cthulhuphant
- Strength growth per level reduced from 3.2 to 2.8.

_______________________________________________

Deadwood

Rotten Grasp
- Damage effect type changed from Magic to Physical.
*The immobilize effect type is still Magic.

_______________________________________________

Defiler

Wave of Death
- Cooldown reduced from 8.5/7.5/6.5/5.5 seconds to 8/7/6/5 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Doctor Repulsor

Ludicrous Speed
- Cooldown increased from 0.4 seconds to 0.5 seconds.
- Passive Mana Regeneration changed from 2/4/6 + 0/50/100% to 2/3/4 + 0/40/80%.
- Mana spent from this ability no longer triggers effects that occur when mana is spent (e.g., Nome's Wisdom).

+ Doctor Repulsor received too much healing from Nome's Wisdom. After these changes, his performance should return back to an acceptable level.

_______________________________________________

Draconis
- Strength growth per level reduced from 2.5 to 2.4.

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master

Drink
- Critical Damage multiplier reduced from 1.5/1.6/1.7/1.8x to 1.3/1.4/1.5/1.6x.

+ Drunken Master had a little too much of everything to make him viable. His damage output has been reduced to better balance his overall performance in higher level skill brackets.

_______________________________________________

Electrician

Electric Shield
- Mana spent on this ability no longer triggers effects that occur when mana is spent (e.g., Nome's Wisdom).

Energy Absorption
- Mana gained per enemy hit increased from 12/16/20/24 to 15/20/25/30.
- Cooldown reduced from 15 seconds to 13 seconds.

+ Electrician has been underperforming in the lower-to-middle skill brackets. Improving his mana sustain should ease some of his issues throughout the game.

_______________________________________________

Engineer

The Keg
- Cast Range increased from 750 to 800.

_______________________________________________

Fayde

Reflection
- Magic Damage dealt based on the target's current Health reduced from 10/20/30% to 10/17/24%.

_______________________________________________

Flint Beastwood
- Starting Attack Damage increased from 36-42 to 37-44.

Dead Eye
- Percentage chance of proccing True Strike for self and allies affected by the Dead Eye aura changed from 25/50/75/100% to 30/40/50/60%.

+ Flint Beastwood's performance has dropped ever since his Attack Range was reduced. He received some numeric buffs for the laning phase without bringing back his previous levels of frustration.
+ The changes of Wingbow and Snake Bracelet prompted Flint Beastwood's True Strike mechanic to be toned down a bit.

_______________________________________________

Hellbringer
- Base Agility increased from 10 to 12.
- Agility gain per level increased from 1.2 to 1.4.
- Strength gain per level increased from 2.1 to 2.2.

Evil Presence
- Active effect: Healing to self on active state increased from 10/15/20/25% to 15/20/25/30% of Damage the affected enemies receive.
- Passive effect: Healing based on damage dealt when off cooldown increased from 3/6/9/12% to 4/8/12/16%.

+ Hellbringer has fallen out of the meta. Increasing his overall survivability should make him viable again.

_______________________________________________

Ichor

Life Leech
- Heal effect now also applies to non-hero ally units attacking the affected target.
*Note that this heal effect will still not apply to certain attackers, like towers and gadgets.

_______________________________________________

Jeraziah

Righteous Strike
- Cooldown reduced from 8 seconds to 7 seconds.

Sol's Blessing
- If state is dispelled before it expires naturally, then its current duration is reduced by 80% and becomes unpurgeable.

+ Purge effects have been hard countering Jeraziah and preventing him from seeing any meaningful presence in competitive play. By making the effect less binary upon being dispelled, Sol's Blessing will still partially retain their effectiveness when purged.

_______________________________________________

Keeper of the Forest

Nature's Guidance
- Bonus armor and Health Regeneration for ally structures reduced from +3 to +1.
- Magic Damage per second for the rooted state increased from 40 to 70.
- Root state duration increased from 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8 seconds to 1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds.

Root
- If state is dispelled before it expires naturally, then its current duration is reduced by 80% and becomes unpurgeable.

+ Keeper of the Forest's defensive play patterns for structures was a little too frustrating to play against, so its bonuses have been reduced on ally structures.
+ To compensate for this, he gains more offensive power on Nature's Guidance when rooting an enemy unit.
+ Similar to the changes for Jeraziah, Keeper of the Forest is being hard-countered by heroes with purges (particularly Monarch because of her large AoE purge). By making the effect less binary upon being dispelled, Keeper of the Forest's Root ability will still partially retain its effectiveness when purged.

_______________________________________________

Kinesis

Telekinetic Control
- Lifted objects now teleport to Kinesis if they are too far away.

_______________________________________________

Lodestone

Headsmash
- Mana Cost reduced from 50 to 40.

Lodestone Plates
- Cooldown reduced from 12/10/8/6 seconds to 11/9/7/5 seconds.

Shatterstorm
- Mana Cost reduced from 150/200/250 to 125/175/225.

+ Lodestone has been underperforming in lower-to-middle skill brackets. Slightly improving some of his abilities should make him smoother to play without affecting his performance much in higher level skill brackets.

_______________________________________________

Lord Salforis

Mors Certissima
- Magic Damage increased from 120/200/280/360 to 130/210/290/370.

_______________________________________________

Maliken

Possession
- Feared units' Movement Speed buff reduced from 40% to 20%.

+ The change to Possession makes it a little easier for players to click on the units that have the fear effect.

_______________________________________________

Monarch

Crippling Pollen
- Total Magic Damage dealt over its duration reduced from 110/160/195/230 to 100/150/180/210.

Noxious Cloud
- Magic Damage per second reduced from 15/25/35/45 to 15/22/28/35.
- Noxious Nightcrawler's ward duration reduced from 6 minutes to 4 minutes.
- Max ward count from Noxious Nightcrawler reduced from 1/2/3/4 to 1/2/2/3.

+ Monarch's defensive niche is excellent, though she is too good at average to higher level of play because she also has a formidable offense for being a defensive specialist.
+ Reducing her overall damage potential and her overall vision uptime from her Noxious Nightcrawlers will allow for more reasonable counterplay against her, while making her offense notably weaker than other support heroes.

_______________________________________________

Moraxus

More Axes
- Projectile Speed increased from 1200 to 1300.

_______________________________________________

Myrmidon

Forced Evolution
- While Forced Evolution is active, Myrmidon's attacks gain 70% of Myrmidon's excess Attack Damage above the static Attack Damage values.
*For clarification: each point of Attack Damage Myrmidon has above 125/175/225 will grant 0.7 bonus Attack Damage (instead of granting 0 bonus Attack Damage).

+ Currently, Myrmidon's Forced Evolution sets his Attack Damage to be a static value (125/175/225), which makes building Attack Damage on him incredibly inefficient.
+ This simple change makes it so that in case Myrmidon somehow gets more than that static value of Attack Damage, the extra Attack Damage will not be wasted on him.

_______________________________________________

Nomad

Edge Counter
- Damage Reduction decreased from 20/25/30% to 20%.

_______________________________________________

Nitro
- Starting Attack Damage increased from 43-50 to 46-53.

Ballistic
- Magic Damage dealt per shrapnel increased from 6/12/18/24 to 7/14/21/28.

Overdrive
- Initial Attack Speed bonus increased from 100 to 200.

+ Nitro has still been underperforming. As a hero that is strong in lane, some changes have been made to ensure that momentum is better carried past the laning phase.

_______________________________________________

Oogie

Conflagrate
- Mana spent on this ability no longer triggers effects that occur when mana is spent (e.g., Nome's Wisdom).
*Exception: Oogie's Primal Surge (as it is intended to work with Oogie's abilities).

_______________________________________________

Ophelia

Nature's Wrath
- Mana Cost reduced from 90/100/110/120 to 75/90/105/120.

Ophelia's Judgment
- Mana Cost reduced from 175 to 100/115/130/145.

Command
- Mana Cost reduced from 100/105/110/115 to 95/100/105/110.

_______________________________________________

Parallax

Earthshatter
- Mana consumed over time no longer triggers effects that occur when mana is spent (e.g., Nome's Wisdom).
*Mana spent on initial cast still triggers these effects, as it is a static number.

_______________________________________________

Pebbles

Stalagmites
- Total base Magic Damage done by the ability (without considering Chuck) increased from 85/145/205/265 to 100/160/220/280.
*Damage increase by Chuck is unaffected (it was already increasing the Magic Damage from Stalagmites by 100/160/220/280).

Chuck
- Cooldown reduced from 14/13/12/11 seconds to 13/12/11/10 seconds.

+ After readjusting other heroes, Pebbles has been slightly underperforming again. These small buffs should let him keep up with the current meta.

_______________________________________________

Prophet

Debilitate
- Now applies a tapering 30% Movement Speed Slow.
- Projectile speed increased from 1350 to 2250 units per second.

Invigorate
- Cast effect type changed from Magic to True.
*This change allows Prophet to cast Invigorate on allies that are Magic-Immune.

Persecution
- Projectile speed increased from 1350 to 2250 units per second.

Shared Fate
- Targeting scheme changed from self-position to target position.
- Now has a cast range of 600.
- Radius reduced from 1000 to 800.

+ Prophet's Shared Fate is problematic for the intended role that Prophet is played in (support/semi-carry). Reverting Shared Fate's targeting scheme should resolve this issue.
+ Debilitate is lacking as a standalone harass tool. By adding a tapering slow to the effect, it will somewhat rival Persecution as a harass tool in the laning phase.
+ The projectile speed of the initial projectiles from Debilitate and Persecution were increased to match that of his Invigorate ability. These projectile speed changes makes Prophet feel much more responsive to play.

_______________________________________________

Puppet Master

Voodoo Puppet
- After becoming unkillable, increased Voodoo Puppet's lifetime from 1.4/1.8/2.2 seconds to 1.5/2/2.5 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Qi

A Thousand Cuts
- Mana spent over time on this ability no longer triggers effects that occur when mana is spent (e.g., Nome's Wisdom).
*Mana spent on initial cast still triggers these effects, as it is a static number.

_______________________________________________

Revenant

Defile
- Bonus Magic Damage per attack increased from 40/70/100/130 to 50/80/110/140.

_______________________________________________

Riptide

Undertow
- Magic Damage increased from 30/45/60/75 to 40/60/80/100.

_______________________________________________

Sapphire

Quickshield
- Cooldown reduced from 18 seconds to 17 seconds.
- Quickshield's Attack Speed buff now persists for the remainder of the state duration if the shield dissipates.

Crystallize
- Now deals 20/40/60 True Damage and applies a 1 second Restrain to affected enemies when Crystallize's duration ends.

+ Sapphire has been underperforming for a long period of time. Prior to her initial nerfs, she had too much utility in her kit.
+ With every other hero being rebalanced, she can now receive some quality of life changes to keep up with other semi-carry and carry heroes.

_______________________________________________

Scout

Vanish
- Attack Speed bonus while active increased from 75/150/225/300 to 90/170/250/320.

_______________________________________________

Silhouette

Shadow
- Like a Ninja's (swap sub-ability) cast action time for the first 1000 units of her Shadow illusion's distance away from her has been reduced from 0.15 seconds to 0.1 seconds.
*Overall, this reduces the cast action time of the swap sub-ability by 0.05 seconds for each 1000 unit distance threshold between herself and her Shadow illusion.

_______________________________________________

Tremble

Dark Swarm
- Physical Damage per second reduced from 32/48/64/80 to 30/45/60/75.
- Damage Reduction from enemies outside of Dark Swarm's radius decreased from 30/40/50/60% to 20/30/40/50%.

Hive Mind
- Cooldown reduced from 60 seconds to 60/50/40 seconds.
*Effective cooldown reduced from 100 seconds to 100/90/80 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Tundra

Call of Winter
- Cooldown for Shiver respawn increased from 60/50/40/30 seconds to 80/70/60/50 seconds.
- Detection radius for enemy heroes increased from 400 units to 500 units.

+ Shiver's vision benefits were a little too good with little counterplay and no risk. These changes will reduce Shiver's overall uptime if killed and make it slightly easier to detect Shiver.

_______________________________________________



= Items =



= Faux Bow and Wingbow Changes =

Faux Bow (Reworked)
- Components: Alacrity Band (1200) + Fleetfeet (450) + Recipe (550) = 2200 Gold Total
- Grants: 30 Attack Speed, 6 Agility, +4 Attack Damage
- Passively grants 100 Attack Range for ranged heroes.
*Does not stack with Wingbow.
- Faux Bow does not have an active ability anymore.

Snake Bracelet
- Cost reduced from 1100 Gold to 1000 Gold.
- Passive Evasion chance reduced from 25% to 15%.

+ Snake Bracelet was offering too much mitigation against autoattacks for its price point.

Wingbow
- Component buildup changed to: Dancing Blade (3000) + Faux Bow (2200) + Snake Bracelet (1000) = 6200 Gold Total
*Total Cost increased from 5700 Gold to 6200 Gold.
- Agility bonus increased from 30 to 32.
- Evasion mechanics changed:
*For Melee heroes who wield the item: 35%
*For Ranged heroes who wield the item: 20%
- Passive Attack Range bonus for ranged heroes increased from 100 to 150.
*Does not stack with Faux Bow.
- Passive Movement Speed bonus for melee heroes increased from 20 to 25.

+ Faux Bow's original concept was flawed from its inception.
+ By making it grant bonus Attack Range early and making it upgrade to Wingbow, it opens up more item options and build paths for agility heroes.
+ To make Wingbow's benefits less polarizing when comparing melee to ranged heroes, Wingbow now grants more Evasion to melee heroes compared to ranged heroes.



= Savage Mace and Riftshards Changes =

Halberd (New)
- This item has returned to Newerth!
- Cost: 1000 Gold
- On attack impact, has a 30% chance to gain True Strike and deal 60 Physical Damage.
*Does not stack with Savage Mace.

Riftshards
- Component buildup changed to: Broadsword (1200) + Broadsword (1200) + Recipe (925) = 3325 Gold Total for level 1 of the item
*Total Cost increased from 2625/3550/4475/5400 Gold to 3325/4250/5175/6100 Gold.
- Critical Strike proc chance increased from 20% to 25%.

Savage Mace
- Component buildup changed to: Slayer (2200) + Halberd (1000) + Recipe (1100) = 4300 Gold Total
*Total Cost reduced from 4800 Gold to 4300 Gold.
- Physical Damage dealt upon proccing reduced from 140 to 120.
- Proc chance increased from 33% to 40%.
- Attack Damage bonus reduced from 64 to 55.
- Proc effects do not stack with Halberd.
*True Strike chance remains at 100%.

+ Savage Mace has been underperforming in comparison to Riftshards.
+ The buildup change and overall cost reduction should enable it to be picked up more, particularly since Wingbow is receiving a change as well.
+ Overall damage gained per gold spent has been slightly improved compared to before.
+ Riftshards in particular was also a little too powerful for its ease of buildup, so its cost was increased according to its power level.

_______________________________________________



= Brand-type Item Changes =

Dawnbringer
- Strength bonus reduced from 18 to 16.
- Agility bonus reduced from 18 to 16.
- Intelligence bonus reduced from 18 to 16.
- Attack Damage bonus reduced from 15 to 12.
- Attack Speed bonus reduced from 25 to 20.
- Passive Movement Speed bonus reduced from 12% to 10%.

+ Dawnbringer's passive attribute bonuses were reduced to be the sum of its parts. Only its brand-specific benefits now have a minor bonus when upgrading to Dawnbringer.

Frostwolf's Skull
- Attack Damage bonus increased from 10 to 15.

Geometer's Bane
- Recipe Cost reduced from 900 Gold to 700 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 5200 Gold to 5000 Gold.
- Passive Movement Speed bonus increased from 10% to 12%.
- Attack Speed bonus increased from 15 to 25.
- Illusion lifetime reduced from 20 seconds to 15 seconds.
- Cooldown reduced from 70 seconds to 60 seconds.

+ Geometer's Bane illusions have a lower lifetime in exchange for a slightly lower cooldown.

Grimoire of Power
- Intelligence bonus increased from 26 to 30.
- Mana Regeneration increased from 3 to 4.

+ Each of the Brand/Blessed Orb combination items were adjusted accordingly to better contrast them against Dawnbringer's general all-rounder benefits.

_______________________________________________



= Damage Block Item Changes =

Iron Shield
- Chance to block damage against enemy heroes increased from 70% to 80%.

Helm of the Black Legion
- Max Health bonus increased from 250 to 270.
- Health Regeneration per second increased from 6 to 7.
- Block chance increased from 50% to 60%.

Ultor's Heavy Helm
- Max Health bonus increased from 250 to 300.
- Health Regeneration per second increased from 6 to 8.
- Block chance increased from 50% to 60%.

+ This line of items has been underperforming in the current meta, so they have been buffed slightly (with care that the meta will not shift to be too favourable for tanky heroes).

_______________________________________________



= Other Item Changes =

Armor of the Mad Mage
- Recipe Cost increased from 800 to 1000.
*Total Cost increased from 3200 Gold to 3400 Gold.
- Activation now dispels debuffs from self.
*Cannot be used while Stunned, Perplexed, or while in a state of being unable to act.
- Intelligence bonus increased from 18 to 20.
- Health Regeneration per second increased from 5 to 8.

+ Armor of the Mad Mage's defensive niche was made better on the heroes who can make use of all its aspects (self-purge, negative Magic Armor aura to foes, and Armor for physical survivability).

Codex
- Magic Damage for level 1 Codex reduced from 350 to 330.

+ Codex's level 1 price point and amount of damage being offered of the item is the primary point of contention in terms of balancing the item. It is still generally overperforming very slightly, so a small nerf to its damage is warranted.

Golden Apple
- Healing amount reduced from 80 Health to 75 Health.
- Passive Attack Damage bonus reduced from 2 to 1.5.

Grave Locket
- Recipe Cost reduced from 200 Gold to 150 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 800 Gold to 750 Gold.

+ Grave Locket cost just a tad much for supports to want to pick it up due to their naturally low GPM. This change should help supports consider upgrading Orb of Zamos to Grave Locket a little more often.

Insanitarius
- Recipe Cost reduced from 550 Gold to 500 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 2750 Gold to 2700 Gold.
- Attack Damage bonus while active increased from 31 to 32.
- Health loss per second while active reduced from 45 to 40.

+ Insanitarius has not been frequently seen for a while. Slightly buffing the item should increase its visibility and encourage more Strength heroes to pick up the item for opportunities to outplay their opponents.

Mana Potion
- Cost reduced from 50 Gold to 45 Gold.

Nome's Wisdom
- Max Shield Health reduced from 300 to 200.

- Repicking a hero in a mode that forces the repick to be random will now exclude your original hero from the available pool of heroes to repick from.
- Removed/renamed files with entity name collisions. This removes error printouts for name collisions in the console when loading game assets.
- Rift Beasts set visual effects now appear properly in-game on avatars from the set if you own the whole set.
*Visual effects from owning the entire Rift Beasts set also applies to Rift Devourer and Rift Ravenor, even though they are not part of the Rift Beasts set anymore.



= Heroes =

Circe
- If Twisted Visage is used on Thunderbringer when he recently used Lightning Storm, the ability will now be properly available to use for Circe's mimic.

Deadlift
- Onslaught: affected units can now chase the target through fog without directly sighting or revealing the target.
- Onslaught: the summoned Undead units will no longer run back to Deadlift while Onslaught is active.
*Credits to CarryByKilln for the bug fixes!

Emerald Warden
- Gawain no longer blocks neutral camps from respawning.
- Gawain's Diving Strike's stun (when boosted by Staff of the Master) will no longer pierce through Magic Immunity.

Hammerstorm
- F.L.E.X. Hammerstorm and Savior Hammerstorm now play their voice lines properly when using Brute Strength, if Brute Strength was animation-cancelled.



= Items =

Orb of Zamos & Grave Locket
- When the penalty for the amount of Gold gained from this item is active, its state will display a charge.

Pegasus Boots
- Target is no longer affected by an ally's no-help setting.

Restoration Stone
- Now correctly calculates the cooldown without compensating for the item cooldown reduction mechanics of Grimoire of Power or Mystic Illusion Rune.

Riftshards
- Fixed a damage calculation bug when damage is increased by a "bonusdamageadd" event.

Version 4.9.5
-------------
16 November 2021



== Patch Versioning Change ==

From this point onward, the vast majority of hotfix patches will have their patch version (the third number in the patch notes) actually incremented. This is done to ensure that replay compatibility works between patch versions (even hotfix patches).



== Design ==



= General =

Experience Changes
- Assist Experience Penalty changed from 0/0/20/40/60% to 0/0/10/35/60% for 1/2/3/4/5 real ally heroes within the Experience Proximity of the target.

+ This change was made to lessen the experience penalty for a successful gank involving 3 heroes.



= Heroes =

Deadlift

Onslaught
- Initial radius for creep detection is now increased to 300 plus the cast range of Onslaught.
*This also fixes a bug where the initial radius for creep detection did not increase if Deadlift had Jade Spire in his inventory.

_______________________________________________

Thunderbringer

Lightning Storm
- Can no longer be cast if this ability has been cast within the last 10 seconds.
*Has no realistic effects on regular gameplay, but does affect Lightning Storm's availability if used in conjunction with Restoration Stone.

+ Caster-based items combined with the sheer power of Restoration Stone allows no realistic counterplay against Thunderbringer on a global scope, since their bonuses scale multiplicatively due to their synergy.
+ By allowing more time to elapse between Lightning Storm casts when Restoration Stone is used, Thunderbringer will not be removing every enemy hero's Health as substantially at a moment's notice.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

Codex
- Strength bonus reduced from 6/7/8/9/10 to 4/5/6/7/8.
- Intelligence bonus reduced from 16/18/20/22/24 to 14/16/18/20/22.

= General =

Connectivity Issues
- Rare connectivity issues immediately after loading the map have been resolved.
- The game server's tolerance for players with poor internet connection quality is somewhat more lenient.

Illusion Behaviour
- Illusions that do not inherit orders prior to spawning (i.e., most illusions) now properly have a Stop command issued to them when they spawn.
*This enables these illusions to automatically aggro against enemy units within their aggro range after spawning.

Minimap Ping
- Added a "Mute Minimap Ping from Voice-Muted Allies" option in Options -> Interface → Gameplay.
*If enabled, then you will not see minimap pings from an voice-muted ally.
*Default setting: enabled.

+ This option was implemented specifically for the use case where players on the same team are communicating through external voice servers and wish to voice-mute their ally in-game to prevent hearing their ally twice.

Legionnaire
- Mercenary Legionnaire's Staff of the Master visuals are now displayed correctly when Mercenary Legionnaire is on the Hellbourne team.

Hammerstorm
- Hammer Leap state on self now expires upon death (when boosted by Staff of the Master).
- Tooltip of Hammer Leap (when boosted by Staff of the Master) has been changed to clarify that Hammerstorm leaps to his hammer on the ground (and not directly to the target).

Wildsoul
- Fixed a bug where Wildsoul's Swipe (in Bear Form) did not cause him to automatically aggro to nearby units if he has no other orders in the order queue.



= Items =

Ophelia's Pact
- Stacking a neutral camp one time will no longer immediately complete the stack requirement of the quest.



_______________________________________________


Version 4.9.4
-------------
26 October 2021



== New Content ==

New Draconis Avatar: Abyss Draco
- Feast on your opponents' despair with this undying Draconis avatar!
*Credits to Narandea for the hero icon art!



== Design ==



= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Artesia

Essence Projection
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*While the Essence Projection is active: relocation ability's cooldown reduced to 4 seconds (changed from 2 seconds).
*Essence Projection relocation gains an additional 2 seconds of cooldown if used within 1600 radius of the enemy Well.

_______________________________________________

Lord Salforis

Life Tap
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Cooldown reduced to 3 seconds.

The Undying
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Distance required from the enemy to pause the duration of The Undying increased from 600 units to 900 units.

_______________________________________________



= Heroes =

Adrenaline

Shard Blast
- Base Mana Cost increased from 60/75/90/105 to 65/80/95/110.
- Base Cooldown increased from 2.4 seconds to 2.7 seconds.
*Overall, Shard Blast's possible cooldown values are now reduced from 2.4/1.8/1.2 seconds to 2.7/2.1/1.5 seconds with respect to hitting 2 or more enemy heroes 0/1/2 times within the last 10 seconds.
- Bonus Magic Damage dealt based on your primary attribute reduced from 30/40/50/60% to 20/30/40/50%.
- Touch radius reduced from 100 to 80.
- Projectile speed reduced from 2500 to 2200.

+ Adrenaline's play numbers are in a healthy position, though he is outputting a little too much damage at a slightly too frequent rate. These adjustments should resolve those issues.

_______________________________________________

Aluna

Deja Vu
- Mana Cost reduced from 70/80/90/100 to 60/70/80/90.
- Cooldown reduced from 30/28/26/24 seconds to 24/22/20/18 seconds.

+ Aluna has been slightly underperforming on a consistent basis ever since Emerald Lightning had its early Attack Speed drain nerfed.
+ Deja Vu has a long cooldown with an unnecessarily high mana cost for its level of impact, so reducing these values will allow her to use Deja Vu more liberally.

_______________________________________________

Arachna
- Strength per level increased from 1.8 to 1.9.

Webbed Shot
- Movement Speed Slow increased from 10/20/30/40% to 15/25/35/45%.

Spider Sting
- Max Health of the Spiderling increased from 4 to 4/5/6.

+ Arachna has been consistently underperforming with the shift in the meta (due to items like Lightbrand previously being buffed).
+ The late-game resilience of the Spiderling from Spider Sting has been increased to make the ability more impactful for its active duration.

_______________________________________________

Apex

Decimate
- Attack Damage dealt increased from 0.5/1/1.5/2x to 1/1.4/1.8/2.2x.

Fire Surge
- Now resets Apex's attack cooldown upon use.

_______________________________________________

Blitz
- Attack Range reduced from 500 to 475.

_______________________________________________

Chomp!
- Shield trait: max shield health reduced from 400 to 300.
- Self-healing trait: healing multiplier reduced from 0.5x to 0.4x when damaging enemy heroes.

+ Bramble has been ever so slightly overperforming throughout 6+ patches and has not been talked about. Small nerfs over time will determine if she requires more changes or not.

_______________________________________________

Bushwack

Crippling Dart
- Now also applies a 75% Miss Chance to the affected target for the duration.
- Movement Speed Slow increased from 70% to 75%.

+ Bushwack's niche as a specialized Kongor slayer is a little too narrow. A small quality-of-life change to timing Crippling Dart correctly will make him more useful in actual teamfights.

_______________________________________________

Draconis
- Strength gain per level increased from 2.4 to 2.5.

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master

Drink
- Stun and Debuff duration reduction per charge decreased from 1% to 0.5%.

+ Drunken Master is a little too resilient to crowd control with the recent changes to Drink. This helps alleviate those issues.

_______________________________________________

Fayde
- Base Strength reduced from 20 to 18.

_______________________________________________

Gravekeeper

Corpse Toss
- Now has 2 charges at all levels (instead of having 1/1/2/2 charges).
- Magic Damage rescaled from 60/100/100/140 to 50/80/110/140.
- Stun duration rescaled from 1 second to 0.4/0.6/1/1.2 seconds.
- Mana Cost rescaled from 75 to 55/60/65/70.

+ Gravekeeper gets more flexibility in the laning phase and in his usage of Corpse Toss.

_______________________________________________

Ichor
- Strength growth per level increased from 2.4 to 2.6.

Life Leech
- Cooldown reduced from 14 seconds to 12 seconds.

Saint's Blood
- Now grants a base 5% Damage Reduction.
*Max Damage Reduction increased from 16/24/32/40% to 21/29/38/45%.
- Ichoric Blood active effect no longer depends on Bloodrush in any way.
- Ichoric Blood active effect is now available once level 1 of Saint's Blood is learned.
- Ichoric Blood now heals the affected target for 5/10/15/20 Health.

Bloodrush
- Base Heal per second increased from 15 to 20.

+ These minor buffs after Ichor's adjustments in Patch 4.9.3.1 should make him strong, but fair with appropriate counterplay.

_______________________________________________

Klanx
- Attack Range reduced from 550 to 475.

+ This change allows for more realistic counterplay against Klanx, as well as making it more difficult for him to kite neutral creeps around while farming them (increasing the amount of damage Klanx receives overall when farming neutrals).

_______________________________________________

Kraken

Tsunami Charge
- Travel speed reduced from 1000 to 925 units per second.

Release the Kraken!
- Radius for the pull/Movement Speed Slow/Restrain effect reduced from 300 to 250.

Arcane Shield
- Cooldown reduced from 30/25/20/15 seconds to 24/21/18/15 seconds.
- Buff duration is increased from 6 seconds to 7 seconds after a successful absorption.

_______________________________________________

Nitro
- Attack Range increased from 575 to 600.

Overdrive
- Attack Damage penalty reduced from 60/50/40% to 50/40/30%.

_______________________________________________

Parasite

Draining Venom

_______________________________________________

Pearl

Asphyxiate
- Magic Damage on initial impact increased from 30 to 40.
- Initial impact now also instantly removes buffs on the affected enemy target.

_______________________________________________

Pebbles

_______________________________________________

Puppet Master

Puppeteer's Hold
- Pull force increased from 80 to 80/100/120/140 units per second.

Voodoo Puppet
- Voodoo Puppet is now unkillable. Upon reaching 0 HP, it will persist for another 1.4/1.8/2.2 seconds and then expire.
*Overflow damage will not be amplified after this point.
*Voodoo Puppet still expires if the affected target moves outside of the leash range.

+ Puppet Master's performance has been low ever since his one-trick burst damage playstyle with Assassin's Shroud into Voodoo Puppet has been discouraged with changes in a past patch.

+ Puppet Master and his teammates can now properly use Voodoo Puppet as a damage and crowd-control proxy, without amplifying excess damage to the foe and encouraging one-shot burst damage builds with Voodoo Puppet.

+ This single change to Voodoo Puppet drastically buffs Puppet Master, as damage-time-on-target is greatly increased without directly amplifying damage dealt to the target.

_______________________________________________

Qi
- Base Strength increased from 18 to 22.

_______________________________________________

Rampage

Stampede
- Upon casting Stampede on an enemy hero, now also pings the target on the minimap for your team.
*Also outputs a team-only chat message that tells them you are charging that player with Stampede!
- Now shows a visual effect on the target (only for your team) when they are being targeted by Stampede.

+ Some quality-of-life changes were added for Rampage to let his team know who he is targeting with Stampede.

_______________________________________________

Thunderbringer
- Attack Range reduced from 400 to 350.
- Strength growth per level reduced from 2.5 to 2.

Chain Lightning
- Cooldown increased from 1.75 seconds to 2 seconds.

Blast of Lightning
- Magic Damage reduced from 115/190/265/340 to 105/180/255/330.

Lightning Rod
- Magic Damage changed from 2/4/6/8% to 2.5/4/5.5/7% of target's Current Health.

+ Thunderbringer is finally recognized as a viable hero in competitive play. He is still slightly overtuned, but he overall has a unique niche in the game despite mostly only offering damage in ganks and teamfights.

_______________________________________________

Tremble

Hive Mind
- Uncontrollable Shudder's Attack Damage increased from 60/90/120 to 70/105/140.
- Attack Range for Shudder (both controllable and uncontrollable) increased from 128 to 150.

_______________________________________________

Valkyrie
- Starting Attack Damage increased from 42-47 to 45-49.

- Bounce projectile speed increased from 600 to 700 units per second.

Cursed Ground
- Magic Damage per second at level 1 of the ability increased from 6 to 8.

Spirit Ward
- Cast Range increased from 400 to 600.
- Projectile speed increased from 1000 to 1300 units per second.

+ Voodoo Jester is not a viable pick at higher levels of play. He has received some buffs that make him more reliable throughout the game.

_______________________________________________

Wretched Hag

Flash of Darkness
- Range reduced from 800/950/1100/1250 to 800/900/1000/1100.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

Adeve's Cloak
- Recipe cost reduced from 1100 Gold to 900 Gold.
*Total cost reduced from 2300/3400 Gold to 2100/3000 Gold.
- Max Health bonus reduced from 180/270 to 150/240.
- Max Mana bonus reduced from 140/180 to 120/160.
- Damage Reduction while active increased from 15%/40% to 20%/50%.
- Stun and debuff duration reduction changed from 15%/40% to 20%/50%.

+ Adeve's Cloak receives some number changes to make it more of a viable choice compared to other cost-effective mid-game items that are commonly picked up on heroes that need to protect themselves from burst damage.

Barbed Armor
- Recipe Cost increased from 800 Gold to 1100 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 2200 Gold to 2500 Gold.
- Cooldown reduced from 40 seconds to 35 seconds.
- Return Damage from Barbed Armor's active effect now ignores 50% of the damage reduced by Armor and Magic Armor.

+ Barbed Armor has been a little ineffective since its adjustment. This increases the item's viability without bringing back the problems it previously had, while maintaining an appropriate price point for its effects.

Ether Jewel
- No longer grants Couriers any amount of Max Mana.

Portal Key
- Range reduced from 1200 to 1100.

+ Portal Key's range is being reduced slightly due to the general attack range and cast range changes that have taken place within the last few patches.

Ward of Sight and Ward of Revelation
- Usage is now disabled when on a Courier.

= Heroes =

Balphagore
- Hell on Newerth (when boosted by Staff of the Master) now properly deals a maximum of 400/550/700 Magic Damage.
*Tooltip said a max of 500/750/900 Magic Damage, but the in-game values were actually the same as its unboosted values (300/450/600 Magic Damage).
*Regardless, the numbers have been changed to be correct.

Berzerker
- Chain Spike is now properly detected by certain sources (e.g. Mana Battery, Power Supply) on the initial cast of the ability.

Pharaoh
- Wrath of the Pharaoh no longer considers Couriers as valid potential targets.

Version 4.9.3.1
-------------
17 June 2021



== Design ==



= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

King Klout

Goblin Toss
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Spawn rate per goblin changed from 2 seconds to 3 seconds.

_______________________________________________



= In-Game HUD =

If an ally player is either voice-muted or on your ignore list, then you will not see minimap pings from them.



= General =

Mystic Illusion Rune
- Cooldown reduction now only applies to Abilities (i.e. not items).



= Heroes =

Adrenaline

Shard Blast
- Base cooldown reduced from 3 seconds to 2.4 seconds.
- When 2 or more enemy heroes are hit, cooldown is now reduced by 0.6 seconds (instead of 0.75 seconds).
*Overall, Shard Blast's possible cooldown values are now reduced from 3/2.25/1.5 seconds to 2.4/1.8/1.2 seconds with respect to hitting 2 or more enemy heroes 0/1/2 times within the last 10 seconds.

Death's Halo
- Now also grants 5 Attack Speed per real hero inside Death's Halo (still 2x the value for enemy heroes).

_______________________________________________

Artillery

LRM
- Percentage of Attack Damage bonus on each LRM rocket increased from 7/12/17/22% to 7/13/19/25%.

_______________________________________________

Empath

As One
- While active, bonus Mana Regeneration per second for self reduced from 2/3/4 to 1.

_______________________________________________

Engineer
- Attack Range increased from 500 to 550.

_______________________________________________

Fayde
- Base Attack Damage reduced from 48-54 to 46-52.

Reflection
- Movement Speed bonus reduced from 20% to 15%.

_______________________________________________

Glacius

Ice Imprisonment
- Magic Damage per second reduced from 90 to 85.

Chilling Presence
- Bonus Mana Regeneration for self reduced from 1.5 to 1.

_______________________________________________

Ichor
- Strength growth per level reduced from 2.6 to 2.4.

Life Leech
- Cooldown increased from 12 seconds to 14 seconds.
- Percentage of missing Health healed (when dealing non-DoT damage to the affected target) changed from 1.5/2/2.5/3% to 2%.
- Now applies a 1.2 second Life Leech Limiter state to the attacker if they do not have one active.
*Attackers with the Life Leech Limiter state receive 0.5x healing from Life Leech.

Transfusion
- Damage transfer from the affected ally unit increased from 20% to 30%.

Saint's Blood
- No longer grants a base 4/6/8/10% Damage Reduction.
*Max Damage Reduction reduced from 20/30/40/50% to 16/24/32/40%.

Bloodrush
- Duration increased from 7 seconds to 8 seconds.
- Radius reduced from 600 to 500 units.
- Cooldown increased from 100/80/60 seconds to 100/90/80 seconds.
- True Damage per second to enemies reduced from 30/35/40 to 25/30/35.
- Base Heal per second reduced from 20/30/40 to 15.
- Healing increase multiplier for Bloodrush procs per enemy hero hit reduced from +0.5x to +0.4x.
*Max extra heal multiplier from Bloodrush reduced from +1.0x to +0.8x.
- Bloodrush no longer has a 1x base heal multiplier on allies affected with Transfusion.

+ Ichor's resilience and healing was a little too self-sufficient (particularly with Life Leech and Bloodrush, combined with Sacrificial Stone), so his numbers have been adjusted to address this.
+ He will also absorb slightly more damage for his allies with Transfusion, while still maintaining a distinct functionality difference from Monarch's Chrysalis.
+ Despite these changes, Ichor still proves to be an incredibly powerful hero and healer.

_______________________________________________

King Klout

Goblin Toss
- Spawn rate per goblin changed from 8 seconds to 6 seconds.
- Red and Green minions no longer apply their initial burst of Magic Damage in an area, and will only affect the target they directly hit.
*In other words, only the Magic Damage over Time (DoT) and Movement Speed Slow effect are applied in an area.
- The Magic DoT effect now stacks up to 5 times.

Conscription
- Now has a 2.5 second cooldown only for upgrading minions upon triggering Conscription on an enemy unit.

+ King Klout's initial burst of area Magic Damage on the Red and Green minions resulted in too much unintentional burst damage in teamfights and farming rotations. The area effect for the burst of Magic Damage was removed to address these issues.
+ To slightly compensate for this damage loss, the Magic DoT effect now stacks.
+ King Klout was mass upgrading minions with Conscription's "hidden" mechanic coupled with Bluster, which is a 100% unintentional side effect from the original designer of the hero. The minion upgrading effect now takes place over a realistic amount of time, instead of it happening for many of his minions at once whenever King Klout is farming creeps.

_______________________________________________

Lord Salforis

The Undying
- State is no longer transferrable (e.g. by Ichor's Transfusion).

_______________________________________________

Monarch

Chrysalis
- Damage Reduction on the affected ally increased from 30/40/50/60% to 35/45/55/65%.

+ This change is necessary to further differentiate the damage reduction between Monarch and Ichor, as Ichor's damage transfer comes with very little downsides to the affected ally unit.

_______________________________________________

Monkey King
- Base Armor reduced from 3.2 to 2.8.
- Strength growth per level reduced from 2 to 1.9.

_______________________________________________

Pearl

Soothing Presence
- Cooldown increased from 20 seconds to 25 seconds.
- No longer has a cast time.
- Now breaks channeling when cast.

_______________________________________________

Rhapsody

Arcane Hymn
- Healing output bonus reduced from 15/20/25/30% to 8/12/16/20%.

_______________________________________________

Shadowblade
- Strength, Agility and Intelligence growth per level reduced from 2.5 to 2.2.

_______________________________________________

Sir Benzington

Heart Piercer
- Magic Armor penetration now applies for all sources of Magic Damage dealt (rather than just Ability Damage).
*The tooltip was previously misleading, so the Magic Armor penetration mechanic has been adjusted accordingly.

_______________________________________________

Thunderbringer
- Attack Range reduced from 450 to 400.
- Base Movement Speed reduced from 310 to 300.

Chain Lightning
- Cooldown increased from 1.5 seconds to 1.75 seconds.

Blast of Lightning
- Cast Range reduced from 800 to 700.
- Magic Damage reduced from 125/200/275/350 to 115/190/265/340.
- Mana Cost changed from 75/95/115/135 to 90/105/120/135.

Lightning Rod
- Distance for dealing 0.5x damage with Lightning Rod increased from 1000 units to 1100 units (to account for Jade Spire).
- Now properly deals 0.5x damage to enemies farther than 1100 units from Thunderbringer.
*This is technically a bugfix, but it affects his balance with regards to Lightning Storm in many situations.

+ Thunderbringer's numbers were a little overtuned (particularly the mana cost to damage ratio on Blast of Lightning), so he should be well balanced after these changes and the bugfix to his Lightning Rod.

_______________________________________________

Tundra

Call of Winter
- Shiver's immunity type changed from Gadget Immunity to Indirect Immunity.
*This means that non-DoT, non-Cleave damage can now kill Shiver in 1 hit.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

Lightbrand Line of Items

Lightbrand
- Bonus Mana Regeneration per second reduced from 2.5 to 1.5.

Frozen Light

Searing Light
- Bonus Mana Regeneration per second reduced from 3.5 to 2.5.

Dawnbringer
- Bonus Mana Regeneration per second reduced from 4.5 to 3.

+ The Lightbrand line of items was still giving far too much value. These changes should make them more comparable to the Firebrand and Icebrand line of items.

_______________________________________________

Dreamcatcher
- State applied to enemies is no longer transferrable (e.g. by Ichor's Transfusion).

Ether Jewel

Golden Apple
- Cost increased from 70 Gold to 75 Gold.

Barbed Armor
- Visual effects no longer play every frame when receiving and dealing DoT damage via Barbed Armor.

Faux Bow
- Faux Bow state now expires on self upon using this item prior to the new Faux Bow state being applied on self (fixes an unintended exploit with Restoration Stone).

*Also refreshes the timer on Umbral Dance.
*Range: 700

+ This Staff of the Master effect allows Fayde more freedom in her ability usage sequence and timings, while simultaneously granting her unique defensive properties after unloading her burst damage on her main target.
+ Credits to Hubaris for the Staff of the Master effect suggestion!

_______________________________________________

Kane

Face Off
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Kane now also gains 50% Damage Reduction against damage sources other than the target.

_______________________________________________



= Ranked Pick =

- Max number of hero bans that can take place at the end of the banning phase increased from 6 to 8.
- Max number of ban votes per player increased from 2 to 4.

+ These changes should allow for more hero diversity in Ranked Pick CoN games.



= General =

- Assist time threshold changed from 10 seconds to 12 seconds.
- HoN Live has been disabled, as it is now considered a deprecated feature (i.e. does not work since a few years ago).

_______________________________________________



= Forests of Caldavar (general) =

- Base Hero Kill Gold Bounty increased from 200 to 230.



= Forests of Caldavar ("New") =

- Hero Kill Gold Bounty per killed hero's level increased from 5 to 10.
- Base Hero Kill Experience Bounty linearly (non-cumulatively) increased by 15 for each level of the killed hero.

+ These changes (coupled with the general Hero Kill Bounty change to Forests of Caldavar) should allow solo heroes (particularly solo heroes that are in the middle lane) to have more impact on the game overall.

- Kongor: while invulnerable at the start of the game, Kongor is also visually hidden.
*A visual timer for Kongor now spawns when the game time initially reaches 0:00.



_______________________________________________



= Heroes - Attack Range Adjustments =

- Attack Range reduced from 600 to 550.

- Attack Range reduced from 600 to 550.

Hellbringer
- Attack Range reduced from 600 to 550.

Ichor
- Attack Range reduced from 475 to 450.

Maliken
- Posession form: Attack Range reduced from 600 to 550.

Moira
- Attack Range reduced from 550 to 525.

Myrmidon
- Attack Range reduced from 500 to 475.

Nitro
- Attack Range reduced from 600 to 575.

- Attack Range reduced from 600 to 550.

- Attack Range reduced from 600 to 550.

Voodoo Jester
- Attack Range reduced from 600 to 575.

Wretched Hag
- Attack Range reduced from 550 to 525.

+ Attack Range has not been leveraged much as a measure of balance. In the past, 600 Attack Range has been a standardized attack range for most ranged heroes - if the hero did not have at least 600 Attack Range, they are considered suboptimal for lane performance.
+ To break away from this standardized Attack Range, many ranged heroes have had their Attack Range readjusted appropriately.
+ Attack Range reductions have many factors contributing to them, with some of the heavier factors being overloaded kits and having long range harass tools/already being good in the laning phase.
+ Generally speaking, 550 Attack Range is the new standard for most ranged carry heroes, while primary support heroes will generally have 600 Attack Range. There are some exceptions due to a hero's overall performance (and due to the factors mentioned above).

+ Overall, the changes to the Attack Ranges will enable more interactions in the laning phase and throughout the game (since ranged heroes generally have to get closer to creeps and enemy heroes to hit them).
+ The Cast Ranges of abilities and items can be adjusted in the future after seeing how the changes in this patch affect the meta. Furthermore, these changes are a small indirect buff to melee heroes in general.

_______________________________________________



= Heroes =

Adrenaline

Shard Blast
- Base Magic Damage increased from 65/105/145/185 to 80/115/150/185.
- Mana Cost reduced from 65/80/95/110 to 60/75/90/105.
- Cast Range increased from 575/650/725/800 to 650/700/750/800.

Death's Halo
- Bonus Strength per real hero caught increased from 3/4/5 to 4/5/6.
*Still 2x the value for enemy heroes.

+ A few small buffs were made to address his low performance after the most recent set of nerfs.

_______________________________________________

Amun-Ra

Ignite
- No longer has a cast time (i.e. no longer interrupts your current order).

_______________________________________________

Artesia

Essence Projection
- Relocation active ability cooldown when the Essence Projection takes damage reduced from 5 seconds to 2 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Balphagore

Corpse Conversion
- Now gains 3 charges whenever the ability is learned or leveled.

_______________________________________________

Berzerker

Strength Sap
- Cooldown reduced from 20 seconds to 20/19/18/17 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Bushwack

Spiked Dart
- Jungle Toxin charge application to targets other than the main target when proccing increased from 1/1/2/2 to 1/2/3/4 for enemy non-hero units.
*Still applies 1/1/2/2 charges to enemy heroes (other than the main target) within the area.

+ This change ever so slightly helps Bushwack with some of his farming problems (but only does so partially).

_______________________________________________

Circe
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 2.4 to 2.5.

Doppelganger
- Mana Cost reduced from 60/70/80/90 to 55/65/75/85.

_______________________________________________

- Cooldown changed from 13 seconds to 14/13/12/11 seconds.

_______________________________________________

- Starting Armor increased from 2 to 2.2.

Guttling Hook
- Physical Damage increased from 90/180/270/360 to 135/210/285/360.
- Cooldown changed from 14 seconds to 15/14/13/12 seconds.
- Mana Cost reduced from 110/120/130/140 to 100/110/120/130.

Cadaver Armor
- Magic Armor increased from 1/2/3/4 to 2/3/4/5.

+ Devourer had few reasons to be picked over the other hook heroes (Gauntlet, Prisoner), so his early game laning and roaming power received a large power spike.

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master

Drink
- Critical Strike damage multiplier increased from 1.5x to 1.5/1.6/1.7/1.8x.

_______________________________________________

Empath

As One
- While active, Empath gains 2/3/4 Mana Regeneration.
- While active, single-target items that could be double-activated to affect yourself now target your host instead (upon double activating).
- The following items are affected by this change for Empath under these conditions:

*Health Potion
*Hypercrown
*Lex Talionis
*Lunar Tear
*Mana Potion
*Null Stone
*Rejuvenation Potion
*Sand Scepter
*Soultrap
*Stormspirit
*Tablet of Command

_______________________________________________

Engineer

The Keg
- Can no longer be double-activated to throw the keg at your current position (this feature was not used in actual games & was a hindrance whenever it was accidentally used).

_______________________________________________

Fayde
- Base Damage increased from 46-50 to 48-54.
- Base Strength increased from 18 to 20.

Reflection
- Movement Speed bonus increased from 10% to 20%.

+ These changes should make Fayde more resilient in the laning phase, as well as smoothen out Reflection's general usage.

_______________________________________________

Flint Beastwood

Dead Eye
- Bonus Attack Range reduced from 85/165/245/325 to 75/150/225/300.

+ This change was done in conjunction with the general Attack Range readjustments so that Flint Beastwood's Attack Range bonus is not too polarizing.

_______________________________________________

Forsaken Archer
- Strength growth per level increased from 1.7 to 1.9.
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.8 to 2.

Call of the Damned
- Proc chance increased from 15% to 20%.

- Magic Damage per arrow increased from 75/125/175 to 85/135/185.

_______________________________________________

Gauntlet

Grapple
- Cooldown reduced from 20 seconds to 16 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Gravekeeper

Defiling Touch
- Now starts off with 1 charge when the ability is leveled.
- Now starts off with 1 charge whenever Gravekeeper respawns.

_______________________________________________

Gunblade

Lethal Range
- Can now toggle this ability to change your Attack Range to Melee.

_______________________________________________

Ichor

Life Leech
- Visual indicator on enemy targets have been improved to be more distinguishable (so that allies are more incentivized to hit that enemy to heal themselves).
- Percentage of missing Health healed (when dealing non-DoT damage to the affected target) changed from 2% to 1.5/2/2.5/3%.
- Magic Damage dealt changed from 90/130/165/200 to 100/150/170/190.

Transfusion
- Damage transfer from the ally unit reduced from 30/40/50/60% to 20%.
- Cooldown changed from 26/22/18/14 seconds to 20/18/16/14 seconds.
- Magic Damage changed from 90/140/190/240 to 100/150/200/240.

Saint's Blood
- Base Damage Reduction against Physical and Magic damage changed from 3/6/9/12% to 4/6/8/10%.
- Bonus Damage Reduction per debuff reduced from 8/9/10/11% to 4/6/8/10%.
- Max Damage Reduction from Saint's Blood reduced from 25/35/45/55% to 20/30/40/50%.
*Max Damage Reduction is now obtained by having 4 debuffs on Ichor (rather than 3/4/4/5 debuffs with efficiency loss on the final debuff).

- When Bloodrush is learned, Saint's Blood gains an active effect.
- Target another ally hero to apply Ichoric Blood to them indefinitely, only expiring if they die or if Ichoric Blood is transferred to another ally hero.
- While within 1200 radius of Ichor, damage dealt by Ichor's autoattacks and non-ultimate abilities to enemy heroes heal the ally with Ichoric Blood for 10/15/20 Health.
*This effect is based on the level of Bloodrush.
*Range: 800
*Cooldown: 1 second

Ability 4: Bloodrush (Reworked)
*Radius: 600
*Mana Cost: 120/160/200
*Cooldown: 100/80/60 seconds

- Activate to create an aura of blood around yourself for 7 seconds.
- While the aura is active, Allies within the area gain 20 Attack Speed, plus an additional 10/15/20 Attack Speed per Ally Hero in radius.
- Enemies within the area also receive 30/35/40 True Damage every second.
- Whenever Bloodrush deals damage to an enemy hero, it heals Ichor and ally heroes affected by Ichoric Blood or Transfusion within 1200 radius for 20/30/40 + 1/1.5/2% of Ichor's Max Health.
*This effect can be amplified further by 0.5x for each enemy hero hit after the first (max of +1.0x).
*Other ally heroes within the radius of Bloodrush that are not affected by Ichoric Blood or Transfusion get healed for 0.5x this amount.

+ Most heroes in the game have one-time burst heals, and most heals do not scale as the game progresses. The existing spammable sustained heals (Soul Reaper, Demented Shaman) heal for a small amount of static Health.
+ The aim of the Ichor rework is to transition him away from granting allies a large amount of Damage Reduction (that is Monarch's role) and to transition him to having sustained, scalable healing in teamfights that scales as the game progresses.
+ This playstyle makes Ichor a proactive support hero with high durability that is encouraged to rush into the front lines of a teamfight, damaging as many enemy heroes as possible to sustain his team's Health.
+ His new Bloodrush ability also encourages his team to have at least 1 other frontline hero to take advantage of the healing around Ichor.
+ Transfusion still serves as a powerful mobility tool, as well as a constant debuff transfer tool for protecting allies.

_______________________________________________

King Klout

Goblin Toss
- Red minion: base Magic Damage increased from 30/40/50/60 to 70/90/110/130 (same as Blue minion), Magic Damage over time reduced from 55/70/85/100 to 15/20/25/30.
*Total damage taken over time remains unchanged.
*Green's minion also inherits Red minion's effects.

+ This adjustment was made to accommodate King Klout's new Staff of the Master effect with Goblin Toss.

_______________________________________________

Lodestone

Lodestone Plates
- Damage Reduction against a damage source with 150 or more Damage increased from 35% to 40%.

_______________________________________________

Martyr

Guardian Angel
- Non-lethal SuperiorMagic Damage to allies has been changed to Health Loss based on Magic Armor.
*This results in no functional change, other than getting the calculations to be correct if there are other damage mitigation/amplification sources on the target.
- Health Loss can now only reduce the target's Health to a minimum of 7% of their max HP.

_______________________________________________

Monarch

Chrysalis
- Damage Reduction increased from 25/35/45/55% to 30/40/50/60%.

+ A small change to further differentiate Monarch from Ichor. Monarch's Chrysalis is one of the most powerful damage mitigation tools for a single ally hero in the game.

_______________________________________________

Parallax
- Attack action time reduced from 0.45 seconds to 0.35 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Parasite

Infest
- Minimum cooldown increased from 5 seconds to 7 seconds.

Soothing Presence (Reworked)
*Radius: 600
*Mana Cost: 70/80/90/100
*Cooldown: 20 seconds
- Passively grants 0.8/1.2/1.6/2 Health Regeneration per second to nearby ally heroes for each nearby allied hero.
*Passive effect is disabled while the ability is on cooldown.
- Activate to immediately heal all nearby allies for 100/150/200/250 Health, but lose the passive Health Regeneration aura effect for the cooldown.

Bubble Pop! (Subability of Soothing Presence)
*Range: 600
*Mana Cost: 50
*Cooldown: 35/30/25/20 seconds
- Target a location to travel there by using bubble momentum.
*Pearl takes 0.75 seconds to reach target destination.
*Default hotkey of this ability: "D".

+ Pearl gets her old Soothing Presence ability back, while still getting a leap to initiate/escape as a support hero (although on a much longer cooldown, with no bonus effects).
+ The separation of the healing effect from the leap effect is necessary for Pearl to maintain her defensive role, while still having enough offense to pose a threat to enemy teams with her Bubble Pop to Preservation initiation combo.
+ Yes, Pearl will be viable in Mid Wars again with these changes.

_______________________________________________

Prophet

Invigorate
- Casting target scheme changed from self position to target entity.
*Can still only target ally heroes.
- Targeting an ally will still apply the heal on yourself.
*Now has a Cast Range of 800.
*Can still be double-activated to cast the heal on yourself, propagating the heal effect to the closest ally hero within 800 radius.

+ This change was made to make Prophet viable for higher level play, while still keeping the overall smoothness of his ability usage flow if he does not wish to target a specific ally hero.

_______________________________________________

Rampage

Stampede
- Movement Speed bonus linger duration reduced from 1 second to 0.5 seconds.

Horned Strike
- Cooldown increased from 6.5 seconds to 7 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Riptide

In My Element
- No longer hides Riptide on the minimap to his enemies.

Perfect Storm
- While Perfect Storm is active, Riptide is now hidden on the minimap to enemies as long as there are no visible enemy heroes within 2000 radius.

_______________________________________________

Shadowblade
- Strength, Agility and Intelligence growth per level increased from 2 to 2.5.

_______________________________________________

Slither

Poison Spray
- Initial Magic Damage increased from 70/80/90/100 to 75/90/105/120.
- Magic Damage per tick increased from 15/25/40/50 to 15/30/45/60.

Poison Burst
- Cooldown reduced from 140/120/100 seconds to 110/90/70 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Soulstealer

Soulsteal
- Soul loss on death reduced from 50% to 40% of your current number of Souls.

_______________________________________________

Thunderbringer
- Attack action time reduced from 0.5 seconds to 0.4 seconds.

Chain Lightning
- Cooldown reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5 seconds.

Blast of Lightning
- Cast Range increased from 700 to 725/750/775/800.
- Magic Damage increased from 100/175/250/325 to 125/200/275/350.
- Stun duration increased from 0.1 seconds to 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4 seconds.
- Clearvision and True Sight duration increased from 4.5 seconds to 5 seconds.

Lightning Storm
- Clearvision and True Sight duration increased from 4.5 seconds to 5 seconds.

+ Thunderbringer has not seen high level play because of having little utility in his kit.
+ He is designed to be a simple hero by design and should remain that way, so some general buffs (coupled with the general Attack Range changes to the hero pool) should make him viable in some team compositions at high level play.

_______________________________________________

Tremble

Terrorform
- Terror Mound: Cast Range changed from Global to 600/2000/5000/Global.
- Boris: number of hits to die reduced from 3 to 2.

+ This change was meant to prevent players from globally destroying trees without putting themselves at risk at the start of the game. It only affects high level play for the most part.

_______________________________________________

Tundra
- Strength gain per level increased from 2.5 to 2.7.

Avalanche
- Cast action time reduced from 0.5 seconds to 0.35 seconds.
- Mana cost reduced from 150/175/200 to 130/160/190.

_______________________________________________

Voodoo Jester

Mojo
- Now applies its 0.5x of its effect to other affected units within 500 radius of the target.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

New Item: Blood Ruby
- Cost: 550 Gold
- Passively grants +150 Max Health.
*Found in the Relics shop.

+ Blood Ruby acts as a buildup item for other items in the game that have Max Health bonuses.


New Item: Ether Jewel
- Cost: 450 Gold
- Passively grants +120 Max Mana.
*Found in the Relics shop.

+ Ether Jewel acts as a buildup item for other items in the game that have Max Mana bonuses.


New Item: Nihil Crystal
- Cost: 200 Gold
- Passive effect: grants 0.5 Mana Regeneration per second.
*This effect does not stack with itself or Adeve's Cloak.
- While off cooldown: upon taking an instance of an attempted 60+ non-DoT Spell Damage, regenerates 40 Health and 20 Mana over 10 seconds and places the item on cooldown.
- Cooldown: 30 seconds
*Found in the Relics shop.

+ Nihil Crystal is another option for Health and Mana sustain against Spell Damage while in lane. It will be a semi-reliable source of sustain for heroes in the suicide lane.



New Item: Adeve's Cloak
- Components: Blood Ruby (550 Gold) + Ether Jewel (450 Gold) + Nihil Crystal (200 Gold) + Recipe (1100 Gold) = 2300 Gold Total
*Can be upgraded 1 time, for a max item level of 2.
*Total cost is therefore 2300/3400 Gold.
- Passive stat bonuses: +180/270 Max Health, +140/180 Max Mana, +0.65/0.8 Mana Regeneration
*The passsive Mana Regeneration bonus does not stack with itself or Nihil Crystal.
- Passive effect: while off cooldown, taking damage from player-controlled enemy sources starts a 3 second timer on the item and starts accumulating damage. The timer is refreshed each time you take damage from player-controlled enemy sources.
- If the accumulated post-mitigation damage exceeds 20% of your Max Health or 300 (whichever is higher) while the timer is active, the item is placed on cooldown and Adeve's Protection is applied for 3 seconds.
- Adeve's Protection applies:
*15/25 Health Regeneration per second
*10/20 Mana Regeneration per second
*Increase your Debuff and Stun Reduction by 15/40%.
*Reduces incoming Damage by 15/40%.
*Reduces your Damage Output by 85/60%.
- Cooldown: 80 seconds
*Found under the Protective category in the shop.

+ Burst damage has been an incredibly potent highlight of HoN's lifetime, to the point where not much can be done against it (i.e. the burst damage cannot be humanly reacted to).
+ This item serves to mitigate the damage incurred from a surprise blink-initiation without needing to react to it so that your character has a more likely chance to respond if they are caught off guard.
+ It is important to note that this item is not meant to be a hard counter against opponents with amazing initiation (it is still very possible the wielder can still die even with these effects) - it is just another tool for heroes who benefit greatly from using their spells in a teamfight to have a chance to use those spells instead of simply dying from burst damage.
+ This item provides no offensive bonuses and costs a decent amount of Gold for its benefits. It is intended to be a niche item for certain heroes in specific game scenarios, and is generally disincentivized for certain core heroes and carry heroes.



New Item: Faux Bow
- Components: Alacrity Band (1200) + Soulscream Ring (440) + Fleetfeet (450) + Recipe (910) = 3000 Gold Total
- Grants: 30 Attack Speed, 8 Strength, 14 Agility, 8 Intelligence
*Found under the Combative category in the shop.

*Range: 700
*Cooldown: 20 seconds
- Active: Target an enemy hero within cast range to gain 70 bonus Attack Speed, infinite attack range and a 50% chance to gain True Strike against the target for up to 6 seconds or 4 attacks. Only grants infinite attack range on ranged heroes.
*Note that this behaviour will not allow your hero to attack another target that is currently outside of your regular attack range due to existing coding limitations. Your hero will not attempt to attack if you try to do this.

+ Faux Bow allows heroes to have a method of finishing off fleeing targets that escape their Attack Range, while offering a mid-cost pickup option for ranged heroes that grants a decent amount of survivability.

_______________________________________________

Items with Buildup Changes

Arcane Bomb
- New component buildup: Blood Ruby (550) + Ether Jewel (450) + Recipe (900) = 1900 Gold Total
*Total cost was increased from 1650 Gold.
- No longer grants 4 Strength, 4 Agility and 14 Intelligence.
- Now passively grants 150 Max Health and 180 Mana.

+ Arcane Bomb now gives about twice as much Max Health compared to before, while being slightly easier to build up and being able to take advantage of some changes earlier.
+ The item is quite prevalent in the meta, so the total cost has been increased to account for all factors.
+ These changes are both a buff and a nerf.

Brutalizer
- New component buildup: Slayer (2200) + Mighty Blade (1000) + Recipe (200) = 3400 Gold Total
*Total cost was reduced from 3450 Gold.
- Passive Strength bonus increased from 8 to 12.
- Physical Damage on proc increased from 35 to 70.
- Stun duration on proc increased from 1.4 seconds to 1.5 seconds.

+ Brutalizer had little reason to be bought, so some proper adjustments were made to make it a more commonly viable option for heroes to use.

Codex
- New component buildup: Neophyte's Book (1000) + Major Totem (540) + Recipe (1000) = 2540 Gold Total
- No longer grants bonus Attack Damage.
- Now grants 6/7/8/9/10 Strength, 4/5/6/7/8 Agility and 16/18/20/22/24 Intelligence.
- Magic Damage dealt by the active part of the item changed from 400/500/600/700/800 to 350/450/600/750/900.
- Cast Range changed from 600/700/800/900/1000 to 600/675/750/825/900.
- Cooldown changed from 40/36/32/28/24 seconds to 30/28/26/24/22 seconds.
- Mana Cost changed from 180/160/140/120/100 to 120/135/150/165/180.
- Visual effects for the lightning now change with level!
*The colour order is white/green/blue/purple/red for levels 1/2/3/4/5 of the item.
*Credits to Whyzozerious for the visual effect improvements!

+ Codex was always known as a non-viable item because of its lack of relevant bonuses while building it, as well as its high cost for what it grants.
+ Making the item more accessible early on at a reduced price cost while increasing its rewards as you level it should make this a more viable item pickup in actual games.

Puzzlebox
- New component buildup: Blood Ruby (550) + Ether Jewel (450) + Ether Jewel (450) + Recipe (1050) = 2500 Gold Total
- Total cost per level of Puzzlebox changed from 2975/4000/5025 Gold to 2500/3550/4600 Gold.
- No longer grants 11/13/15 Strength and 18/22/26 Intelligence.
- Now grants 200/250/300 Max Health, 250/300/350 Max Mana, and 4/7/10 Attack Damage.

+ In today's meta, Puzzlebox takes a little too long to build up. These buildup changes should buff the item so that it sees play more often.

_______________________________________________

Lightbrand Line of Items

Lightbrand
- Searing Damage-over-Time (DoT) effect increased from 8 to 9 Magic Damage per second per charge.
- Max charges for Searing reduced from 3 to 2.
*This reduces the overall Searing Damage by ~25%.

Frozen Light
- Searing Damage-over-Time (DoT) effect increased from 12 to 13 Magic Damage per second per charge.
- Max charges for Searing reduced from 3 to 2.
*This reduces the overall Searing Damage by ~25%.

Searing Light
- Searing Damage-over-Time (DoT) effect increased from 12 to 13 Magic Damage per second per charge.
- Max charges for Searing reduced from 3 to 2.
*This reduces the overall Searing Damage by ~25%.

Dawnbringer
- Searing Damage-over-Time (DoT) effect reduced from 18 to 15 Magic Damage per second per charge.
- Max charges for Searing reduced from 3 to 2.
*This reduces the overall Searing Damage by ~45%.
- Movement Speed Slow reduced from 40%/20% to 30%/15% if its wielder is Melee/Ranged, respectively.

+ Dawnbringer was just a tad too effective despite its high cost. Its passive on-attack effects were toned down closer to the level of the Tier 2 brands.
+ Lightbrand items in general were too efficient for what they are doing, so their Searing damage numbers were readjusted.

_______________________________________________

Alchemist's Bones
- Gold Bounty from killing a creep with its active effect increased from 165 Gold to 190 Gold.
- Experience Bounty multiplier from killing a creep with its active effect increased from 1.75x to 2x.

Beastheart
- Max Health bonus increased from 215 to 230.

Doom Bringer
- Base Attack Damage bonus increased from 250 to 300.
- Max charges reduced from 25 to 20.

+ This makes the item more of a viable pickup for comebacks, if they are attempted in specific scenarios.

Dreamcatcher
- While not at max charges, passively gains 1 charge every 3 minutes.

Ghost Marchers
- Ranged heroes now only receive a 15% Movement Speed bonus from the active state (instead of 20%).

Golden Apple
- No longer passively grants Mana Regeneration.
- Instead, now passively grants +2 Attack Damage.

Jade Spire
- Bonus Cast Range reduced from 250 to 150.
- Recipe Cost reduced from 600 Gold to 300 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 2400 Gold to 2100 Gold.
- No longer has item drop or pickup restrictions (though its cast range bonuses still do not stack).
- No longer has a different version of the item in Mid Wars.

+ Cast Ranges are integral to relative hero balance, and modifying this value too much makes some heroes more polarizing than others if they obtain this item.
+ The Cast Range bonus is still large enough to make a difference, but it will be nowhere nearly as frustrating to deal with against certain heroes, while still providing a reasonably potent cast range increase to make a difference.

Kuldra's Sheepstick
- Cast Range reduced from 650 to 600.

Lunar Tear
- Passive Health Regeneration bonus increased from 0.4 to 0.5.
- Cost reduced from 80 Gold to 75 Gold.

Runed Cleaver
- Cleave Damage increased from 50% to 60%.

Sustainer
- Now passively grants 5 Attack Damage.

Toxin Claws
- No longer refunds any Gold when sold.

- Map: Forests of Caldavar ("New" for NAEU/International region, "Old" for SEA region)
- Mode: Ranked Pick



Mid Wars

- Single Draft



== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==



= General =

- Hero Mastery in the Learnatorium is now sorted properly.
- Mid Wars: fixed a cliffwalking spot near the Hellbourne teleporter cliff.
- Camera shake effects have been drastically reduced in magnitude.



= Heroes =

Certain abilities that are classified as "non-interrupting" (i.e. did not interrupt your current order) will now properly and intentionally interrupt the current caster's channeling state (if they are channeling).
*This generally does not change anything for most scenarios. However, there are some abilities that are clearly not meant to be used while channeling. Some notable examples include (but are not limited to):
*Artillery's Mortar Shot
*Cthulhuphant's Obliterate
*Prisoner's Prison Break
*Goldenveil's Dagger Dance
*Swiftblade's Counter Attack
*Lodestone's Shatterstorm

Chipper
- Rocket Barrage now has a touch effect type of Magic (i.e. will pass through units that have Magic Immunity).

Gemini
- Heropets (Fire, Ice and Light) are now properly deniable only if their Current Health percentage is less than 10% of their Max Health.
- Doom Bringer is now dropped properly when Gemini is in split form if damaged by player-controlled enemy units (i.e. this mechanic is propagated from Doom Bringer onto the split form units).

Lodestone
- Lodestone Plates now triggers properly under the intended conditions.

Nymphora
- Grace Nymphora's Teleport count (for teleporting ally heroes) is now correct.

Parallax
- Earthshatter (when boosted with Staff of the Master) now deals the correct amount of damage if Parallax's max mana is greater than the target's.

Qi
- Damage from Enlightenment now uses the correct damage multiplier when the damage source is from Ancestral Assault.

Tremble
- Terror Mound unit size has been increased slightly so it can be clicked more easily.
*This does not affect the size of the Terror Mound visual.



= Items =

Bound Eye
- Now properly drops on death in all circumstances.

Dreamcatcher and Soultrap
- Health Regeneration effect no longer gets dispelled by neutral creeps (and is now consistent with the behaviour of Health Potion, Mana Potion, etc.).

Version 4.9.2.1
-------------
15 April 2021



== Design ==



= Heroes =

Adrenaline

Shard Blast
- Cast Range rescaled from 800 to 575/650/725/800.
- Base Magic Damage rescaled from 80/115/150/185 to 65/105/145/185.
- Mana Cost changed from 50/70/90/110 to 65/80/95/110.

+ These changes should make Adrenaline more bearable in the laning phase without changing his performance after the laning phase.

_______________________________________________

Cthulhuphant

Maddening Revenge
- Radius for an enemy source to trigger Maddening Revenge increased from 900 units to 2000 units.
*This information is now indirectly mentioned in the tooltip. Hover over the ability to show the radius.

Plague Rider

Plague Carrier
- Ancient creeps killed by Plague Carrier now only grant 60/80/100% of the original Experience and Gold to Plague Rider.
- Projectile speed increased from 700 to 900 units per second.

_______________________________________________

Qi

Enlightenment
- Damage-over-Time effects from Qi's abilities now apply the corrected amount of 0.75x the bonus damage per game frame (instead of 1x the bonus damage).
- "Extra" Attack Speed considered by the damage calculation is now capped at 250.
*These changes prevent Qi from doing excessive amounts of damage to heroes who get a large burst of Attack Speed in short durations (e.g. Silhouette, Scout).
*Note that Qi will still do a lot of damage to these heroes, but they will not be unreasonably large damage values.

_______________________________________________

Rampage

Horned Strike
- Cooldown increased from 6 seconds to 6.5 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Shadowblade

Gargantuan's Blast
- Magic Damage increased from 55/110/165/220 to 70/120/170/220.

Feint's Siphon

_______________________________________________



== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==



= Forests of Caldavar ("New") =

- Extra blockers have been added to the nearby cliffs of the Legion and Hellbourne Ancients camps to prevent heroes from stacking them from the middle lane by direct pathing near the cliffs.



= Heroes =

Cthulhuphant
- Default avatar and King Cthulhuphant avatar now have the proper Trample effects.
- Trample now generally spawns less afterimage visuals of Cthulhuphant.
- All Cthulhuphant avatars now have visual effects for Maddening Revenge.
- Daemon Highlord Cthulhuphant now uses the proper voice lines for Dreams of Madness, Obliterate, and his taunt.
- Enemies now gain Sight of Cthulhuphant if they are forced to attack Cthulhuphant during Dreams of Madness.
*Credits to Gimj for submitting some of these changes!

Corrupted Disciple
- Corrupted Conduit's damage state now expires on the affected unit if they respawn (addresses a rare bug where the damage state will linger after death).

Ichor
- Visual effects from Saint's Blood no longer play when receiving DoT damage.

Parasite
- Infest now grants the proper amount of Gold and Experience if the Infested creep's lifetime expires naturally.

Soulstealer
- Toggling the Dread aura no longer dispels certain states (e.g. Assassin's Shroud).

Warchief
- Warchief now stops in place properly after Spirit Walk is cast (there were edge cases where this was still occurring).

Version 4.9.2
-------------
30 March 2021



== Design ==



== New Content ==

Legacy loading screens have been rotated into the game.
- Reminisce in the early days of Newerth!

New Throwback Avatar: Throwback Bramble
- Relive Bramble's earliest moments in Newerth!



= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Blood Hunter

Hemorrhage
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Radius increased from 250 to 325.

_______________________________________________

Ophelia

Command
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Movement Speed bonus granted to an ancient creep changed from 0.25x of the original bonus to 10.

_______________________________________________

Prisoner

Prison Break
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Activation on self now reduces the effect delay by 50%.
*Prior to this patch, casting on self did not actually make the effect instant, so it is both a bugfix and a balance change.

_______________________________________________



= Staff of the Master Visuals =

The following heroes now have proper Staff of the Master effect visuals when they receive the state from Master's Legacy:
- Arachna
- Artesia
- Blacksmith
- Calamity
- Corrupted Disciple
- Draconis
- Ellonia
- Engineer
- Gauntlet
- Jeraziah
- Keeper of the Forest
- Legionnaire
- Lord Salforis
- Madman
- Martyr
- Monarch
- Pestilence
- Prisoner
- Rally
- Rhapsody
- Riftwalker
- Scout
- Tempest
- Zephyr



= Illusion Visuals =

Illusions now have a new visual effect!
- Instead of simply applying a green texture over the original model, it now uses a light-blue translucent material over the model.
*This visual effect for illusions will only apply for the owner of the illusions and their allies.
*In other words, enemy illusions will not appear to have this visual effect on them.



= Forests of Caldavar =

- Ally player-controlled non-hero units near the Level 3 Towers will have unitwalking for the first 2 minutes.
- All NPC Neutral creeps now have Push Immunity for the first 2 minutes.

+ These changes will address specific unintentional behaviours from being leveraged too early on in the laning phase of the game for 1 team to get a high reward without reasonable counterplay (or without an appropriate level of risk).
+ These unintentional behaviours can still be used after the first 2 minutes. By that time, all players have more appropriate tools and levels available to them to have reasonable counterplay.
+ These changes have no impact on regular gameplay.



= Neutral Creeps =

Catman Champion
- Bonus Mana Regeneration per second granted to allies from the aura reduced from 2 to 1.

Minotaur
- Attack Speed bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 20 to 15.

Vagabond Leader
- Bonus Health Regeneration per second granted to allies from the aura reduced from 5 to 4.
- Magic Damage dealt by Ground Pound reduced from 170 to 150.

Vulture Lord
- Armor bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 2 to 1.



= Mid Wars =

Banning Draft
- Ban phase time increased from 15 seconds to 30 seconds per round.
- Hero selection time increased from 20 seconds to 40 seconds per round.
- Time period after all heroes have been picked (but before the game starts) increased from 20 seconds to 30 seconds.



= Heroes =



Adrenaline

Shard Blast
- Mana Cost changed from 55/70/85/100 to 50/70/90/110.
- Base Magic Damage reduced from 80/120/160/200 to 80/115/150/185.
- Cooldown reduced from 4 seconds to 3 seconds.
- Cooldown reduction for Rush decreased from 1.5 seconds to 1 second per enemy hero hit.
- When the Shard hits 2 or more enemy heroes, the mechanics have changed.

- Old mechanic:
*Cooldown is reduced to 0.5 seconds and 60% of the Mana Cost is refunded.
- New mechanic:
*Cooldown is now reduced by 0.75 seconds, and Mana Cost on the ability is reduced by 10/15/20/25.
*This effect stacks up to 2 times and lasts for 10 seconds.

Ember Shard
- Max pull distance reduced from 1000 units to 800 units.
- Regular distance at which the enemy unit stops from Adrenaline (when travelling to him) increased from 100 units to 150 units.

Death's Halo
- Bonus Strength per real hero caught reduced from 4/6/8 to 3/4/5.
*Still 2x the value for enemy heroes.
- No longer gains 2 bonus Attack Damage per real hero trapped.

+ Adrenaline's Shard Blast was a little too explosive and lopsided when encountering multiple enemy heroes, and proved to have too much downtime in teamfights when not hitting 2+ enemy heroes.
+ Shard Blast is still intended to perform extremely well when fighting multiple heroes, so its bonus effects will be more fair, sustained and consistent after these changes.

_______________________________________________

Artillery

LRM
- Percentage of Attack Damage bonus on each LRM rocket changed from 7/14/21/28% to 7/12/17/22%.
- Artillery is now Sighted for 1 second if LRM hits an enemy unit (instead of just player-controlled enemy units).
*If you hit a neutral creep, the neutral creep's team will have sight of Artillery (not the opposing Legion/Hellbourne team).
- Base Cast Range reduced from 1200 to 1100.
- Now uses the correct range increase value from Special Ammunition.

Mortar Shot
- Base Cast Range reduced from 1200 to 1100.
- Now uses the correct range increase value from Special Ammunition.

Homing Missile
- Base Cast Range reduced from 1200 to 1100.
- Now uses the correct range increase value from Special Ammunition.

+ Prior to this patch, these 3 abilities were still using the values prior to 4.9.0, despite the fact that they were intended to be reduced.
+ Despite this, Artillery's performance has been significantly higher than intended, so another small nerf was added on top of the intended cast range reduction. This should make his range less polarizing to deal with.

_______________________________________________

Blood Hunter

Hemorrhage
- Initial Superior Magic Damage increased from 200/300/400 to 250/375/500.
- Superior Magic Damage taken per unit travelled increased from 35/55/75% to 40/60/80%.
*Prior to this patch, the values in the tooltip were displayed as 30/45/60% - this change both corrects the tooltips and buffs the ability slightly.

_______________________________________________

Calamity

Funeral Pyre
- Agility gain state on self duration increased from 1.25x to 1.5x the original state duration.

_______________________________________________

Circe

Doppelganger
- Mana Cost changed from 100/85/70/55 to 60/70/80/90.

_______________________________________________

Cthulhuphant

Obliterate
- Using this ability will no longer interrupt your order queue.

Maddening Revenge
- Attackers now also have -30/40/50/60% Healing Received for 0.1 seconds upon attacking Cthulhuphant.
- Receiving damage from Cthulhuphant's front will grant Cthulhuphant 5/10/15/20 Health Regeneration per second for 2 seconds.
- The Health Regeneration effect and Return Damage now only have 0.33x effectiveness on Cthulhuphant's illusions.

+ Although Cthulhuphant is in a generally good state, Maddening Revenge does not have really have much going for the ability at the moment.
+ Granting Cthulhuphant slightly more durability and preventing regular lifesteal from being a hard counter to this ability will allow this ability to be more worth leveling during the game.

_______________________________________________

Deadlift

Onslaught
- Cast effect type changed from Magic to Physical.

_______________________________________________

Devourer
- Starting Armor increased from 1.16 to 2.

_______________________________________________

Draconis

Fiery Barrage
- Dragonflame now only spreads the flames once from Ablaze (instead of spreading it 4 times).
- Base Magic Damage per 4 seconds increased from 5/10/15/20 to 20.
- Damage rate increase per charge reduced from 100% to 70%.
- Max charges reduced from 8 to 5/6/7/8.
- Damage multiplier against heroes increased from 0.5/0.8/1.1/1.4x to 0.8/1/1.2/1.4x.

+ Draconis has the ability to take camps using the unique mechanics of Fiery Barrage (where you damage different enemies to maximize damage by spreading the fire) without taking damage. However, it was too easy to quickly reach the max potential damage of Fiery Barrage against stacked neutral camps by using Dragonflame.

+ These changes should slow down Draconis' damage rate against large stacks of neutral creeps with a lower level of Fiery Barrage for his level 1-4 jungling from autoattacks, while simultaneously ensuring that 1 Dragonflame cast does not nearly wipe out an entire camp. Overall, jungling should be better for the average player early on, while the damage output against stacks should be slower when Draconis is level 3-6.

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master

Stagger
- Using Lunge now resets the cooldown of Stagger (instead of reducing its cooldown to 0.8 seconds).

Drink
- Now instantly grants 3/6/9/12 Drink charges upon starting the channel.

3 Point Strike
- Strike point reset delay increased from 8 seconds to 12 seconds.

+ Just a few more quality-of-life changes to Drunken Master to improve his combat flow in accordance with his Drink usage.

_______________________________________________

Empath

Essence Link
- Tether break range increased from 100 to 200.
- State on Empath (or the target ally hero, if used while As One is active) is no longer considered a buff (and thus can no longer be dispelled).
*This ensures that Essence Link does not get dispelled if As One is used after Essence Link is cast.
*Note that the debuff on the enemy can still be dispelled, which will cancel Essence Link on Empath (or her host from As One).

_______________________________________________

Engineer

The Keg
- Magic Damage increased from 90/150/210/270 to 90/160/230/300.
- Stun duration increased from 1.6/1.8/2/2.2 seconds to 1.6/1.9/2.2/2.5 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Fayde

Shadow Walk
- Now properly acts as a disjoint upon activation.

_______________________________________________

Flint Beastwood

Hollowpoint Shells
- Bonus Physical Damage reduced from 20/40/60/80 to 16/34/52/70.
- Stun duration reduced from 0.05/0.1/0.15/0.2 seconds to 0/0.05/0.1/0.15 seconds.
- Now only procs against enemy units (i.e. no longer procs against wards or ally units).

Money Shot
- Cooldown changed from 20/15/10 seconds to 20 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Goldenveil

Dagger Dance
- Now deals 3.5/5/6.5/8 Magic Damage every 0.25 seconds to targets other than the main target within the area of effect.

Perch & Plunge
- While Perching on a tree, cooldown is set to 6 seconds if the Perched tree is destroyed.

_______________________________________________

Ichor

Life Leech
- Life Leech's state application now occurs before the Magic Damage takes place.
*This allows the Magic Damage dealt by this ability to trigger from the Life Leech state, allowing Ichor to gain a small amount of healing when Life Leech's projectile hits an enemy.

_______________________________________________

Keeper of the Forest

Nature's Guidance
- Stealth state on Keeper of the Forest will not be dispelled if Nature's Guidance is cast while near trees.

_______________________________________________

Klanx

B.A.N.G.
- State duration for enemies facing the flash increased from 1.5 seconds to 2 seconds.

Lackey
- Shots now deal 0.33x damage in a 300 radius to enemies around (but excluding) the main target.

_______________________________________________

Kraken

Release the Kraken!
- Now constantly applies Restrain to enemies within radius.

_______________________________________________

Ophelia

Nature's Wrath
- Cast Range increased from 600 to 700.

Command
- Movement Speed bonus for creeps reduced from 10/20/30/40 to 15/20/25/30.
- Max Health bonus reduced from 40/120/160/200 to 0/60/90/120.
- Creeps controlled with Command now have a minimum Base Health of 600/700/800/900.

+ Combined with the neutral creep changes in this patch, these changes should slightly reduce Ophelia's performance later in the game without destroying the hero's performance and unique tempo control during the early game.
+ These changes also allow Ophelia to have some other targets for Command as the game progresses without sacrificing much durability on them.

_______________________________________________

Pandamonium

Flurry
- Now destroys trees within its affected area.

Flick
- Now deals 20 Physical Damage to the target upon landing near them.
- Delay for flicking (after landing near the target) reduced from 0.4 seconds to 0.35 seconds.
- Pandamonium is no longer stunned for a full 0.5 seconds before actually flicking the target backwards.
*Instead, the stun duration on Pandamonium for his Flick animation now matches the delay time for flicking (0.35 seconds).

Face Smash
- Pandamonium now faces the target after every attack.
*This ensures that Pandamonium faces the target consistently, if for some reason the target or Pandamonium are displaced without breaking the channel.

+ Some simple quality-of-life changes were made to Pandamonium, making him feel more responsive for the player playing the hero.

+ Pandamonium's Flurry now has more consistent behaviour while near a tree line, and he can act a little sooner out of the Flick animation.

+ The small damage addition to Flick makes it a more reliable tool to put an enemy's Portal Key on cooldown and dispel an enemy's Health Potion, etc.

_______________________________________________

Parasite

Infest
- Experience and Gold granted to Parasite when the Infested Creep dies is now a static 125 Experience and 75 Gold (rather than the values based off of the Infested Creep).
*This will always happen regardless of how the Infested Creep dies.

*These values are the highest values among the strongest units in the Hard neutral camps.
- If an enemy player has damaged the creep within the last 10 seconds, the enemy team also will receive the static amount of Experience and Gold split evenly among each enemy player.

+ These changes ensure that the behaviour of the death of the Infested Creep is consistent for both Parasite and his opponents, while also making a failed gank much less punishing for Parasite.
+ The changes prevent Parasite from completely denying his opponents of Experience and Gold, while also preventing his opponents from denying Parasite Experience and Gold if they kill the creep.

_______________________________________________

Plague Rider
- Base Strength increased from 18 to 19.
- Base Intelligence increased from 18 to 20.

Extinguish
- Cooldown reduced from 60/50/40/30 seconds to 45/40/35/30 seconds.

Plague Carrier
- Cooldown reduced from 140/100/60 seconds to 100/80/60 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Puppet Master

Puppeteer's Hold
- Duration increased from 2.5/3.15/3.85/4.4 seconds to 2.6/3.3/3.9/4.5 seconds.

Voodoo Puppet
- Cooldown reduced from 130/120/110 seconds to 120/110/100 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Qi

Crippling Puncture
- Movement Speed tapering midpoint shifted from 15% to 50% of the total slow duration.
*This is a small buff, as the tapering mechanic starts later in the slow duration.

Ancestral Assault
- Initial delay reduced from 0.6 seconds to 0.4 seconds.
- Number of instances changed from 1/2/3 to 3.
- SuperiorMagic Damage reduced from 125 to 50/90/130.
- Triggered damage from Enlightenment caused by Ancestral Assault deals 0.4/0.7/1x Damage.
- Disarm and Perplex duration changed from 1 second to 0.5/0.75/1 seconds.
- Now also applies a 20% Movement Speed Slow.

+ These changes should smooth out Ancestral Assault and make its performance more appropriate at each phase of the game, without making it feel bad in the early phases of the game.

_______________________________________________

Rampage

Stampede
- Movement Speed bonus now lingers for 1 second after hitting the target.

Horned Strike
- While moving, cooldown is reduced at a rate of (Movement Speed)/1000 seconds.

The Chains That Bind
- Physical Damage dealt increased from 25/35/45% to 35/45/55% of the distance travelled.

+ Rampage's kit now plays more towards having higher Movement Speed and encourages Rampage to keep moving!

_______________________________________________

Riptide

Perfect Storm
- Cooldown reduced from 160/120/80 seconds to 130/105/80 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Shadowblade

- Base Strength, Agility and Intelligence reduced from 25 to 22.
- Strength, Agility and Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.8 to 2.
- Starting Attack Damage reduced from 55-58 to 47-50.

Soul's Sight
- Mana Cost increased from 45/50/55/60 to 50/60/70/80.
- While Soul's Sight is active, Mana Cost is increased to 70/100/130/160.
*This is done to compensate for the extra mana you get from Intelligence form.
- Stun duration reduced from 0.9/1/1.1/1.2 seconds to 0.5/0.6/0.7/0.8 seconds.
- Magic Damage dealt on initial proc reduced from 20/30/40/50 to 16/24/32/40.
- Now procs its one-time bonus on-hit effects when attacking an enemy unit (as opposed to just enemy heroes).
- One-time bonus on-hit effect now expires after 5 seconds if it is not used.

Essence Shift
- When Strength is your main attribute: max Health lost per point of bonus Strength granted by this ability reduced from 3 to 2.5/2/1.5.

+ Shadowblade has been liked mostly as a carry that can choose and change their main attribute/build throughout the game, rather than a jack-of-all-trades hero. These changes will change his stats to be more suitable for the carry role.
+ These changes will also reduce the extremes of his current frustrations (Soul's Sight first-hit effect from the previous patch).
+ The changes to Essence Shift should make Shadowblade's Strength build more viable in the mid and late game without contributing to the frustration of him being unkillable in the early game.
+ Soul's Sight will still have its uses, as it was the most largely neglected form.
+ In the end, all 3 forms should be viable depending on the game & route you want to go with as Shadowblade.

_______________________________________________

Shellshock

Rolling Thunder
- Removed 0.3 second delay from initial activation.
- Delay after actually launching (second activation) increased from 0.1 seconds to 0.2 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Soulstealer

Dread
- Armor penalty for enemies increased from 2/3/4/5 to 3/4/5/6.
- Now also passively grants Soulstealer 0.5/1/1.5/2 Magic Armor Penetration.
- Can now toggle the aura on and off with the "Extra Ability 1" hotkey (default hotkey "D").
*This hotkey change does override the short range Demon Hand cast hotkey - however, most players use the "Primary Ability 1" hotkey (default hotkey "Q") to cast the short range Demon Hand.

_______________________________________________

Swiftblade

Swift Slashes
- Now Sights and Reveals the main target for 0.2 seconds when this ability is fully cast.

_______________________________________________

War Beast

Metamorphosis
- While active, max Movement Speed for your own units reduced from 550/600/650 to 550/575/600.

_______________________________________________





= Items =

Changes to Armor Items:

Ring of the Teacher
- Armor bonus for self increased from 1 to 2.
- Armor bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 2 to 1.
- Mana Regeneration bonus from the aura increased from 0.65 to 0.8.

Abyssal Skull
- Now passively grants 2 Armor to self.
- Armor bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 5 to 3.5.
- Mana Regeneration bonus from the aura increased from 0.8 to 1.0.

Nome's Wisdom
- Now passively grants 2 Armor to self.
- Armor bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 2 to 1.
- Mana Regeneration bonus from the aura increased from 1 to 1.2.

Plated Greaves
- Armor granted to allies from the active state reduced from 1.5 to 1.
- Movement Speed bonus reduced from 65 to 55.

Sol's Bulwark
- Armor bonus to allies from the ally aura reduced from 3 to 2.

+ Armor items have had far too much benefit for allies at such a low cost.
+ The aura effects of these items were generally made weaker so that Physical Damage is not countered so easily and quickly for an entire team in the early phases of the game.

_______________________________________________

Changes to the Mana Battery line of items:

Mana Battery
- Added back into the game (exact same item as Power Supply from Patch 4.9.1, just with a different name, icon and visual effects).
*Cost: 200 Gold
*Available to be purchased in the Relics shop and Outpost.

Power Supply
- Now upgrades from Mana Battery.
- Components: Mana Battery (200 Gold) + Minor Totem (50 Gold) + Minor Totem (50 Gold) + Recipe (240 Gold) = 540 Gold Total
- Passively grants 3 Strength, Agility and Intelligence.
- Maximum of 15 charges.
- No longer purchasable in the Outpost.
- The other effects are the same as Mana Battery.

Sacrificial Stone
- Recipe cost increased from 110 Gold to 420 Gold.
*Total cost increased from 850 Gold to 1500 Gold.
- Base bonus Strength, Agility and Intelligence increased from 5 to 8.
- Increased Healing Done adjusted from +15% to +20%.

+ Mana Battery and Power Supply both fulfilled unique benefits and had solid reasons to be picked up early in the game at their specific price points, so they were both largely reverted back to their legacy states.
+ Sacrificial Stone would be too stat-efficient if its recipe cost was not adjusted, though we still want the item to have a solid reason to be picked up. Therefore, it is now one of the most stat-efficient items to pick up and upgrades from a fantastic item at a moderate (but relatively affordable) cost. It also buffs healing output even more as its particular niche effect.

_______________________________________________

Frostwolf's Skull
- Movement Speed Slow (when used by a melee hero) increased from 35% to 40%.
- Scouting activation: radius increased from 5000 units to 7000 units.
- Scouting activation: cooldown reduced from 30 seconds to 24 seconds.
- Dire Frost Wolf activation: cooldown reduced from 50 seconds to 40 seconds.
- Dire Frost Wolf activation: in addition to its current effects, also applies a 1 second Root on impact.

Ghost Marchers
- Passive Movement Speed bonus reduced from 70 to 60.
- Bonus Attack Damage reduced from 24 to 22.

Grimoire of Power
- Recipe cost reduced from 1100 Gold to 900 Gold.
*Total cost reduced from 5400 Gold to 5200 Gold.
- Active effect has been reworked:
*Activate to grant+30% Spell Damage to self for 15 seconds.

+ The defensive effect on Grimoire of Power was too strong for the game. It is likely to make a return with more appropriate negative side effects on another item in the future.
+ In the meantime, Grimoire of Power's effect is reminiscent of its previous passive effect.

_______________________________________________

Orb of Zamos & Grave Locket
- Bonus gold multiplier increased from 0.25x to 0.75x when a non-player controlled Neutral Creep is killed by the corresponding Synchronized hero.

Ultor's Heavy Helm
- Component change: instead of Ringmail, now requires a Shield of the Five.
- Recipe cost reduced from 1025 Gold to 675 Gold.
*Total cost remains the same (3650 Gold).
- Now passively grants 2 bonus Strength, Agility and Intelligence.
- Active effect now also grants 1 Armor to affected allies.
*Bonus Armor effect does not stack with Plated Greaves or Shield of the Five.
- Damage Block value for self increased from 70 to 80 (35 to 40 if you are a ranged hero that has Ultor's Heavy Helm).

+ Shield of the Five now builds into an item other than Plated Greaves, making Ultor's Heavy Helm more viable (especially with the nerfs to the other team Armor items).
+ Credits to datfizh for the general suggestions for Ultor's Heavy Helm!

Void Talisman
- Recipe cost reduced from 1160 Gold to 1060 Gold.
*Total cost reduced from 1700 Gold to 1600 Gold.

== Matchmaking Maps & Modes ==



Champions of Newerth (CoN)
- Map: Forests of Caldavar ("New" for NAEU/International region, "Old" for SEA region)
- Mode: Ranked Pick



Mid Wars
- Hero Ban
- Single Draft



== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==



= General =

Mid Wars
- Captain's Pick can now be properly hosted on this map for Public Games.

User Interface
- New UI: no longer warns that you have no region selected when attempting to start a Public Game or Bot Match game.
- Lobby music now plays properly (there was something wrong with the encoding of the sound file).
- When a hero denies themselves, the game properly displays a message using gender-neutral terminology ("X has killed themselves").

Healing is now sourced from the appropriate entity for the following sources:
- Accursed's Flame Consumption
- Blood Hunter's Feast
- Deadlift's Soul Syphon
- Defiler's Unholy Expulsion
- Emerald Warden's Forest Touch (from Gawain)
- Hellbringer's Evil Presence
- Nymphora's Volatile Pod
- Warchief's Life Totem (from Sacred Totems)
- Zephyr's Cyclones



= Heroes =

Adrenaline
- Shard Blast's sound effects are now quieter.
- Shard Blast will no longer play a sound for each time it hits an opponent (and instead will only play once per cast instance).
- Ember Shard state on enemies now expire when Adrenaline is dead.
*However, if they are already getting pulled when Adrenaline actually dies, the pull will still continue as intended.
- If the leash range is broken by the target, Ember Shard no longer pulls enemies if they are invulnerable or have Physical Immunity.
- Fixed Death's Halo detection radius so that units from the outside do not accidentally get sucked into the center if they direct path towards the inside (from the outside) and then attempt to walk away again.

Amun-Ra
- Ignite now display the appropriate Magic Damage value in the popup.

Cthulhuphant
- Obliterate's visual model is now correct for the default Cthulhuphant avatar and King Cthulhuphant avatar.
- Sound effects for Dreams of Madness and Obliterate now plays correctly for the Woolly Cthulhuphant, Royal Cthulhuphant, Caller Cthulhuphant, Daemon Highlord, and HoNTour Cthulu avatars.
*Credits to Gimj for submitting some of these changes!
- Trample no longer displaces enemies with Push Immunity.

Deadlift
- Onslaught's leash range is now properly adjusted if Onslaught's cast range is increased (e.g. by Jade Spire).
- All Undead creeps spawned from Onslaught now get the proper Movement Speed state.
- Undead creeps spawned from Onslaught will now have the correct behaviour after being bound to a projectile.
- Soul Syphon now heals for the correct amount when the minions spawned from Onslaught expire.
- Soul Syphon now heals Deadlift properly if a unit with a timed life expires naturally.

Empath
- In-game icon now displays the default avatar icon (rather than the HD avatar icon).

Engineer
- Ol' Briarpatch Engineer's Energy Field gadget model is now properly displayed on Low Model graphic settings.

Gemini
- Light Wolf can now purchase items from an item shop.
*Items will be transferred to Gemini's inventory if there is enough space. Otherwise, it will go to the Stash as per regular behaviour.
*In other words, purchase mechanics are the same as if Fire was purchasing items from an item shop.
*Note that Light does not actually have its own item inventory.

Goldenveil
- Perch & Plunge's cooldown is now set to the correct value when the Perched tree is destroyed.

Ichor
- The healing from Life Leech is now properly sourced from Ichor (not the target).
*Affects interactions from healing increase items like Sacrificial Stone.
- Life Leech's projectile no longer bypasses Magic Immunity if the target gains Magic Immunity after Life Leech has been cast, but before Life Leech's projectile hits them.
- Transfusion's initial projectile now properly deals Magic Damage to enemies in the impact area even if it has been disjointed.

Kane
- Face Off now properly cancels Homecoming Stone if the target is Disarmed.

Legionnaire
- Decapitate no longer attempts to deal Magic Damage to an enemy unit that he was already designated to kill if they meet Decapitate's kill conditions.

Midas
- Midas now travels with the projectile of Elemental Warp.
*This has no gameplay impact in most situations and makes the behaviour consistent with other projectile-based travel behaviour from other abilities.

Nomad
- True Strike now applies a lingering sighted/revealed state on the target for 1 second or until True Strike's attack occurs (whichever occurs first), after its trigger conditions are met (i.e. when entering into melee range of the target).
- True Strike's trigger range reduced from 200 to 175.
*All of these small adjustments to True Strike/Mirage Strike mitigate the instances where the skill is being abnormally cancelled in certain conditions (e.g. near trees when the opponent is attempting to fog you).
*In the majority of circumstances, this will not affect gameplay and only serve as quality-of-life changes.

Pebbles
- Chuck now properly deals damage to the thrown unit when the thrown unit is unbound from the projectile.

Pestilence
- Fixed an exploit where Swarm (when boosted by Staff of the Master) can globally affect an enemy unit.

Prisoner
- The ball and chain from Shackled will now properly follow a unit if that unit becomes order disjointed (e.g. with Fayde's Shadow Walk ability).
- Prison Break's effects (when boosted by Staff of the Master) now properly affects Physically Immune units if targeting self.
- Prison Break's effects (when boosted by Staff of the Master) no longer become dispelled if an affected target gains invulnerability at any point before the state naturally expires.

Rampage
- Might of the Herd no longer interrupts your order queue when activated.
- Tooltip for Horned Strike no longer mistakenly says that it has Bash properties.

Rhapsody
- In-game icon now displays the default avatar icon (rather than the HD avatar icon).

Riptide
- Undertow's tooltip now properly states it deals 30/45/60/75 Magic Damage.
*No gameplay change has been made, as Undertow still deals this damage even prior to this patch.

Shadowblade
- Soul's Sight's effects that apply on the first hit will now properly check for misses (e.g. against Void Talisman or Evasion sources) and immunities (e.g. Shrunken Head) when the attack projectile impacts, rather than predetermining the effect when the attack projectile is launched.
- Fixed some incorrect model positions for Shadowblade's avatars in the HoN store.

Solstice
- Illuminate no longer interrupts your order queue when activated.

Tempest
- Elementals do not inherit their forced-attack order after splitting if they were affected by Deadlift's Onslaught state.

Vindicator
- Space Wizard Merlin's Glyph of Silence now properly plays its catchy space jam soundtrack while it is active!

Wildsoul
- Throwback Wildsoul now shows the correct model in the HoN store and avatar selection screen.

Witch Slayer
- Attack projectiles for Pimp Slayer and Witch Hunter now have the correct models.



= Items =

Bottle, Health Potion, Mana Potion, Rejuvenation Potion, Refreshment Rune effects
- Damage from sources that are non-boss, non-player controlled (NPC) neutral creeps (when not owned by a player) will no longer accidentally disable the active states of these items if the source deals damage to the hero while the source is dead (e.g. a ranged projectile that hits a hero after the source dies).
- Refreshment Rune's state is now consistent with the behaviour of the related state effects from Bottle, Health Potion, Mana Potion and Rejuvenation Potion.

Genjuro
- Each player can only purchase a maximum of 1 Genjuro per game.
- Genjuro can no longer be dropped.

Homecoming Stone
- Disarm state on towers is no longer considered a Debuff.
*This should prevent assist attribution bugs if a tower kills a hero while someone is teleporting to it.

Veiled Rot
- Effect now also applies in a 600 radius around the user for the user's owned units when the fade state expires naturally.
*This does not change much in most situations, but it specifically lets Parasite properly take advantage of Veiled Rot with his Infested creep (i.e. use Veiled Rot, then Infest a creep).

Whispering Helm
- Can no longer be activated on a Mimic (e.g. Moira's Ephemeral Forge, Circe's Twisted Visage).



_______________________________________________


Version 4.9.1
-------------
2 February 2021



== New Content ==

New Loading Screens have been rotated into the game!
- The new loading screen art will represent and celebrate the Lunar New Year!
*This means that the fan art backgrounds (from Patch 4.9.0) will be rotated out of the game. We apologize for the inconvenience.
*We are delighted to have those art pieces in our game, but we regret to inform that a substantial portion of the player base are unhappy with the art. It is unlikely they will return to the game - if they do return, it will be on a background art rotation basis.

New Behemoth Avatar: Exo Behe
- Get ready to electrify your competition with this new Behemoth avatar!

Empath and Rhapsody:
- Base avatars and icons have been reverted to their base versions.
- The HoN China (CN) models and avatars are now available for free in the store!



== Design ==



= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Blacksmith

Chaotic Flames
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Mana Cost reduced from 33% Max Mana to 20% Max Mana.
*Chance to cast Fireball, Flaming Hammer or Frenzy when autoattacking increased from 10% to 15%.

= Cosmetic Updates =

- HUD has been reverted to its state prior to Patch 4.9.0.
- Music tracks have been reverted to their state prior to Patch 4.9.0.
- Christmas is over, thus the Forests of Caldavar ("New") and Mid Wars maps have reverted to its state prior to Patch 4.9.0.
*After some reconsideration, keeping the UI in from February to April is not suitable.

- The priority level of name colours (in which they display in a chat channel) have been readjusted to be more suitable in terms of their overall value.
*The most notable change is the Gold Shield color - players who use this name colour appear above all other non-volunteer, non-staff name colours (for their help to get HoN started)!



= User Interface =

- Region selection checkboxes are now visible in the "Play Now" screen (for the "new UI"), without having to press the "Regions" button.
*This change should improve visibility on what regions a user is queuing for before actually queuing up for a game.

- Region selection for all players will be reset when the patch occurs.
*By default,  no regions will be selected (as opposed to having all of them selected).

+ This change will force players to select the regions they prefer, and should drastically alleviate issues with players playing on servers where they have high ping.



= Forests of Caldavar ("New") =

Kongor Buff Reward
- Movement Speed reward: bonus Movement Speed per charge reduced from 15 to 12.

Neutral Camps
- Slightly reduced the creep max travel distance of the left-most Legion easy camp.

Werebeast Enchanter
- Far Sight's Clearvision radius reduced from 1800 to 1200.



= Ranked Pick =

- Banning Phase duration increased from 20 seconds to 30 seconds.
- Wait time between end of banning phase and start of picking phase reduced from 5 seconds to 3 seconds.


= Matchmaking =

- Player colour order is now fully randomized in Matchmaking and Champions of Newerth games.
*In other words, the player with the highest MMR in Matchmaking and Champions of Newerth games will no longer always be in the Blue or Pink player slot.



= General =

- Ranged Creep aggro range reduced from 800 to 750.



= Heroes =

Adrenaline
- Primary attribute changed from Agility to Strength.
- Base Armor increased from 2.36 to 3.
- Base Strength increased from 20 to 24.
- Strength growth per level increased from 2 to 2.5.
- Base Agility reduced from 24 to 18.
- Agility growth per level reduced from 2.4 to 1.6.
- Base Intelligence increased from 18 to 20.
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.5 to 1.8.

Shard Blast
- Bonus damage is now based on Strength (instead of Agility).
- Mana Cost reduced from 80/90/100/110 to 55/70/85/100.
- Base Magic Damage increased from 80/115/150/185 to 80/120/160/200.
- Bonus Magic Damage based on your primary attribute increased from 20/30/40/50% to 30/40/50/60%.
- Touch radius increased from 90 to 100 (120 on tooltip for cast indicator accuracy).
- Cooldown is now reduced to 0.5 seconds (from 0.6 seconds) when hitting 2 or more enemy heroes with this ability.

Rush
- Now behaves like a regular dash/charge with pathing (i.e. does not force the destination to be at the very end, like Dark Lady's Charging Strikes).
*No longer cuts trees along its path.
- Cooldown reduced from 14/13/12/11 seconds to 13/12/11/10 seconds.
- Range rescaled from 700 to 575/650/725/800.
- No longer has a Dread Stack mechanic.
- Magic Damage changed from 20 + (10 Magic Damage per Dread Stack consumed) to 80/120/160/200 + 30/40/50/60% of your Strength.

Ember Shard
- Tether duration changed from 1.8/2.2/2.6/3 seconds to 2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds.
- Self state duration increased from 4 seconds to 8 seconds.
- Now refreshes attack cooldown on cast.
- Enemies now also receive a 25% Movement Speed Slow (in addition to being Restrained) after being pulled.
- Restrain/Movement Speed Slow state duration changed from 1 second to 0.8/1.2/1.6/2 seconds.

Death's Halo
- Duration is reduced by 1 second when Adrenaline receives cumulative damage equal to 25% of his Max Health (from 20%).
- No longer grants an Agility bonus per real hero trapped.
- Now grants 4/6/8 bonus Strength, 2 bonus Attack Damage, and 1 bonus Armor per real hero trapped (x2 for enemy heroes).
- Magic Armor bonus per real hero caught increased from 1 to 1.5.

+ Adrenaline was dependent on too many attributes, and many options could have been taken to address this. Changing from an Agility hero to a Strength hero was the option that was chosen. With the proper readjustments, he now only requires damage and mana sustain to be effective.

+ Adrenaline was also still not surviving nearly as much as expected against multiple opponents during Death's Halo, so he received significant durability buffs while it is active.

_______________________________________________

Armadon

Armordillo
- Spine Burst damage threshold when taking damage to the rear reduced from 150 Damage to 130 Damage.

_______________________________________________

Artillery

LRM
- Now deals 0.8x Damage to non-hero units.

+ Artillery's weakness of farming was alleviated a little too well. A slight reduction to damage dealt against non-hero units should balance his performance out once again.

_______________________________________________

Calamity

Dragon's Path
- Magic Damage per dragon reduced from 25/50/70/95 to 20/45/65/90.

Funeral Pyre
- Agility gain state on self duration reduced from 1.75x to 1.25x the original state duration.
- Damage dealt by the extra attack instance now deals 50/60/70/80% of Calamity's Attack Damage (instead of 100%).

+ Calamity has seen a recent increase in play rate with great success, particularly in tournament play.
+ Most of her damage is coming from Funeral Pyre and Dragon's Path, so small nerfs to these abilities should make it more bearable to deal with her in the laning phase and during mid-game.

_______________________________________________

Defiler

Unholy Expulsion
- Spirit Movement Speed and Max Movement Speed increased from 400/450/500 to 650.

_______________________________________________

Draconis
- Base Movement Speed reduced from 300 to 290.

Draconic Defense
- Cooldown increased from 60/55/50/45 seconds to 75/70/65/60 seconds.

Fiery Barrage
- Base Physical Damage per second changed from 6/12/18/24 to 5/10/15/20.

+ These changes should mitigate Draconis' farming speed in the jungle early on and give him a little bit more of a weakness overall.

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master
- Base Agility increased from 12 to 14.

Drink
- Max Charges increased from 16/24/32/40 to 18/27/36/45.
*Total max Evasion and Stun/Debuff Duration Reduction increased from 16/24/32/40% to 18/27/36/45%.
- In addition to existing bonuses, each Drink charge now also grants a 1.5% Chance to Critically Strike for 1.5x Attack Damage.
- Healing from the natural expiration of a Drunk Charge increased from 6 Health to 7 Health.

3 Point Strike
- Physical Damage reduced from 300/475/600 to 250/375/500.

+ Drunken Master has historically been too focused on being bursty and being built as a glass cannon.
+ With the iterations of Drunken Master in 2018-2020, the major complaint was that 3 Point Strike required little to no skill to deal an immaculate amount of burst damage to his targets during the early to mid game.
+ Recent changes have addressed this by making it take a bit more skill to achieve said burst and bring back the healthy mechanics of the original Drink ability, though the hero has been underperforming.

+ To address all of these concerns and address the hero's performance, a decent amount of damage has been shifted from his ultimate and placed into his Drink mechanic.
+ Maintaining a high number of Drink charges allow him to function as a traditional carry/semi-carry, granting him a multitude of defensive and offensive buffs, while still allowing him a choice to Drink for offense/defense and using his skills for mobility/damage while reducing the number of Drink Charges on himself.

_______________________________________________

Fayde

Reflection
- Now reduces the target's Healing Received and Health Regeneration by 20/40/60% for 4 seconds.

+ This small change brings back some legacy effects onto Reflection.

_______________________________________________

Goldenveil

Perch & Plunge
- While perched on a tree, Perch no longer counts as an ability cast for certain sources (e.g. Power Supply).

+ This change is more of a bugfix, but it has more implications on Goldenveil's performance in lane.

_______________________________________________

Ichor

Transfusion
- Cast effect type changed from Magic to SuperiorMagic.
*This allows Ichor to properly latch onto allies and enemies that have Magic Immunity.

_______________________________________________

Keeper of the Forest

Nature's Guidance
- Camouflage will now only apply its root state on enemies when attacking out of stealth if the attacker is a non-illusion Keeper of the Forest hero (i.e. not his minions or other ally heroes).
- Root duration reduced from 1.2/1.6/2/2.4 seconds to 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Kraken
- Base Intelligence increased from 16 to 18.
- Turn rate increased from 360 to 700 degrees per second.

Tsunami Charge
- Travel speed increased from 850 to 1000 units per second.

+ A few small number tweaks for Kraken to keep up with the meta.

_______________________________________________

Monkey King
- Strength growth per level increased from 1.7 to 2.
- Base Armor increased from 2.8 to 3.2.

+ A small survivability buff to Monkey King to keep up with the meta.

_______________________________________________

Moon Queen

Multi-Strike
- Bounce radius increased from 450 to 500.

Lunar Glow
- Moon Queen receives 1.5x the damage bonus from this ability.

+ Moon Queen currently does not have a good enough reason to be picked over Forsaken Archer at the moment. These changes should help her deal more overall damage than Forsaken Archer if she is able to attack her foes.

_______________________________________________

Moraxus

More Axes
- Cooldown increased from 1.25 seconds to 1.5 seconds.

+ The increased number of axes was a sufficient buff to Moraxus on its own. As a result, the cooldown of this ability is being reverted to its original values (prior to Patch 4.9.0).

_______________________________________________

Nitro

Ballistic
- Mana Cost reduced from 15 to 12.

Blast Off
- Mana Cost reduced from 100/110/120/130 to 95/105/115/125.

+ A few minor buffs to Nitro were given as she is slightly underperforming. She should be fine where she is after these changes.

_______________________________________________

Nomad
- Strength growth per level increased from 1.8 to 2.
- Agility growth per level increased from 2.8 to 3.
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 2 to 2.2.

Edge Counter
- On expiration, now grants 20/25/30% Damage Reduction for the next 5 seconds.
*This state propagates to illusions he spawns while active.

+ These changes should give Nomad just the right amount of durability he needs without making him too frustrating to deal with.

_______________________________________________

Ophelia

Nature's Wrath
- Cast Range reduced from 800 to 600.
- Duration reduced from 6 seconds to 5 seconds.

Command
- Cast Range reduced from 900 to 600.
- Cooldown increased from 8 seconds to 15 seconds.

+ Ophelia has been picked and banned more frequently in competitive matches, so she is receiving a few nerfs. She will still be able to dominate the early game, but just does it a little less effectively now.

_______________________________________________

Puppet Master
- Base Movement Speed reduced from 300 to 295.

Whiplash
- No longer passively grants Attack Speed.

Voodoo Puppet
- Voodoo Puppet's Max Health increased from 500/700/900 to 500/750/1000.
- Damage multiplier reduced from 130/155/180% to 110/120/130%. 
- Cooldown changed from 150/135/120 seconds to 130/120/110 seconds.
- Leash Range increased from 1000 to 1500.
- Now passively grants Puppet Master 15/30/45 Attack Speed.

+ Puppet Master's burst damage as a carry with ganking tools has been too high throughout the history of HoN.
+ With the latest free passive bonus Attack Speed on Whiplash and Elder Parasite being a new meta item pickup for Puppet Master, his burst damage potential has been dampened in favour of having a bit more sustained damage over time compared to before.
+ Voodoo Puppet is gradually becoming more of what it was originally designed for: a damage proxy for when the target goes out of range, and a proxy to apply Crowd Control to the target without being near the target. It can still be used to burst a target down at close range, but it is just less effective at doing so.
+ Elder Parasite will also be receiving a minor nerf in conjunction with this change, as the item in general has been proven to be a little too powerful after its recent changes. These combined changes should put Puppet Master in a better state than before.

_______________________________________________

Rhapsody

Disco Inferno
- Magic Damage dealt to enemies reduced from 20/30/40/50 to 18/27/36/45.
- Healing per second applied to allies reduced from 13/22/31/40 to 10/18/26/34.

+ Rhapsody has been performing well since her changes in the previous patch. Her numbers on Disco Inferno were proven to be a tad high, so they are being reduced slightly to compensate.

_______________________________________________

Shadowblade

- Strength, Agility and Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.5 to 1.8.

Gargantuan's Blast
- Gargantuan Form no longer changes Base Attack Time.

Feint's Siphon
- Attack Damage drain now applies against enemy non-player-controlled units with 0.5x the original values.

Soul's Sight
- The first attack against an enemy hero in this form deals a bonus 20/30/40/50 Magic Damage and applies a 0.9/1/1.1/1.2 second Stun.

+ After looking at Shadowblade's performance, part of his kit has been reverted more closely to its legacy form, while still allowing Shadowblade to leverage factors (such as the Attack Damage steal from Ancients and Kongor) without them being too good in those situations.

+ Soul's Sight now also provides more support-oriented bonuses to allow Shadowblade to have some capabilities as a support hero when underfarmed or when underperforming. Soul's Sight also gained a bit more laning utility to help Shadowblade perform better in this phase.

_______________________________________________

Shellshock

Rolling Thunder
- Now has a 0.3 second delay after the initial activation (to prevent accidental activation).

_______________________________________________

Succubus

Mesmerize
- Cast Range rescaled from 625 to 530/570/610/650.

+ These changes make Succubus have a little more reward for leveling Mesmerize, while reducing its Cast Range to a more reasonable amount during the laning phase.

_______________________________________________

War Beast

Metamorphosis
- While active, max Movement Speed for your own units increased from 550 to 550/600/650.

_______________________________________________

Witch Slayer
- Base Movement Speed increased from 290 to 295.
- Base Intelligence increased from 23 to 25.
- Intelligence growth per level reduced from 3 to 2.8.
- Projectile speed increased from 900 to 1100.

Power Drain
- Cooldown reduced from 25/20/15/10 seconds to 17/14/11/8 seconds.

Silver Bullet
- Magic Damage changed from 650/750/850 to 550/750/950.

+ Witch Slayer is still not great in a competitive environment - these changes aim to keep him more relevant in the meta, while reducing the polarizing performance of Silver Bullet slightly (while maintaining it as a net buff prior to patch 4.9.0).

_______________________________________________

Xemplar

Fractal Field
- Fractal Field trigger radius for Xemplar's illusions increased from 900 to 1200.

Wall of Mirrors
- Wall of Mirrors trigger radius for Xemplar's illusions increased from 900 to 1200.

+ Xemplar's Wall of Mirrors also received some bugfixes (mentioned in the Bug Fixes & Optimizations section of the patch notes), which indirectly nerfs him to an appropriate power level.

_______________________________________________

Zephyr

Wind Shield
- The Evasion mechanic from this ability now only functions against ranged attackers.
*This prevents melee units from missing if they attack at the edge of Zephyr's hurtbox and Zephyr is currently moving away from an enemy melee unit.

_______________________________________________



= Items =



Barbed Armor 
- Duration reduced from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.
- Returned Damage type is now the same as the received damage type.
- Returned Damage percentage increased from 65% to 80%.
- Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.

+ The Returned Damage type change makes it so that the wielder of Barbed Armor will not reduce the amount of Damage Returned to their attacker based on the wielder's Armor/Magic Armor value (this was counter-synergy and was why Barbed Armor was considered a "bad item" in the past).

+ Instead, the damage will now be returned of the appropriate type, so that the Returned Damage will be mitigated by the appropriate Armor type of the attacker (and not the wielder of Barbed Armor).

+ Overall, these changes allow appropriate counterplay from the attacker's perspective without the effect of Barbed Armor being too strong, while still enabling Barbed Armor to do its job and scale appropriately as the game goes on.

_______________________________________________

Elder Parasite
- Passive Attack Damage bonus reduced from 10 to 5.
- Damage Amplification for damage received while the state is active increased from 12% to 15%.
- Passive bonus Attack Speed reduced from 20 to 15.
- Recipe Cost increased from 600 Gold to 800 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 2000 Gold to 2200 Gold.

+ Elder Parasite is supposed to be a mid-game high-risk, high-reward item for autoattack carries, and has been readjusted accordingly to fill this role. It was just a tad too good in the previous patch.

_______________________________________________

Lightbrand, Frozen Light, Searing Light, Dawnbringer, Grimoire of Power
- The Searing state is no longer applied in a 200 radius.

Grimoire of Power
- Debuff Reduction and Stun Reduction state duration reduced from 1 seconds to 0.6 seconds.
- Recipe Cost increased from 700 Gold to 1100 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 5000 Gold to 5400 Gold.
- Can no longer be activated while Perplexed or under a Forced Order effect (e.g. Legionnaire's Taunt).
- Cooldown increased from 70 seconds to 90 seconds (becomes 72 seconds after its own cooldown reduction mechanic).
- Now applies an Activation Modifier state for 2 seconds, which prevents other Activation Modifiers from being applied while active.
- Now uses an Activation Modifier (i.e. this cannot be active at the same time as Shrunken Head or Void Talisman).

+ Grimoire of Power has proven to be an incredibly viable item pickup option in the game compared to Frostwolf's Skull and Geometer's Bane (finally). In fact, it is likely a little too good right now, as this item also allows you to farm better compared to its counterparts. Because of this, a cost increase is perfectly justified.
+ The active effect has been nerfed a little bit to make sure that it still does what it should do (allow the user to cast at least one final ability after breaking CC) without that duration being too long, as well as preventing items like Shrunken Head from being used to guarantee an escape.

_______________________________________________

Ioyn Stone
- Can now be purchased at the Outpost.

_______________________________________________

Iron Shield
- Deflection chance against enemy heroes reduced from 100% to 70%.

+ This change allows the item to still be a strong pickup on melee Agility heroes in the laning phase, but does not enable their trades to be too effective.

_______________________________________________

Orb of Zamos & Grave Locket
- Now only generate 0.25x bonus Gold when a non-player controlled Neutral Creep is killed by the corresponding Synchronized hero.

+ This item was simply not intended to synergize well with heroes that clear Neutral Creeps throughout the game.

_______________________________________________

Pegasus Boots
- Now prioritizes teleporting to ally heroes before prioritizing other targets.

_______________________________________________

Power Supply
- No longer has a recipe (i.e. it is a standalone item now).
- Now costs 200 Gold.
- No longer passively grants bonus Strength, Agility or Intelligence.
- Max charges reduced from 15 to 10.
- Can now be purchased at the Outpost.

Sacrificial Stone
- New component buildup: Power Supply (200) + Major Totem (540) + Recipe (110) = 850 Gold Total
- Increased Healing Done adjusted from +10% to +15%.
- Health restored per charge increased from 10 to 12.

+ Power Supply now functions like the old Mana Battery - it was too cost-efficient for the stats it provided at the 300 Gold price point, and there was a need for the item to be at a low cost for its active functionality.

+To prevent changing the item hotkey order once again, Power Supply and Sacrificial Stone were properly adjusted (rather than reintroducing Mana Battery).

_______________________________________________

Veiled Rot
- Now applies to the user even if they are invulnerable (addresses a corner case when respawning at fountain right away).

_______________________________________________

Void Talisman
- Recipe Cost increased from 960 Gold to 1160 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 1500 Gold to 1700 Gold.
- Passive Strength, Agility and Intelligence bonus reduced from 6 to 5.
- While Void Talisman is active, your hero deals 25% less Damage.

+ Void Talisman now carries a little bit more of a penalty when used, as well as it being less efficient of an item when picked up.
+ It should still be accessible enough to support heroes, while reducing the damage output of certain heroes while active.

*Additionally, the target becoming invulnerable will no longer break the chains.

- Enlightenment now properly deals SuperiorMagic Damage when boosted by Staff of the Master.

Rally
- Kyugo Rally's Seismic Slam sound effects are now played properly when boosted by Staff of the Master.

- Magic Damage applied from Wall of Mirrors is now scaled properly based on the level of Schism.

== Design ==



= Hero Rework - Adrenaline =

+ Adrenaline has been reworked to have a completely new niche, specializing in catching heroes with high mobility.

+ Death's Halo is the crux of the rework, essentially being changed to act as an "Arena" skill. This skill forces all units to essentially be confined within a space for a duration, essentially locking down a teamfight to take place in an area.

+ As a result, Adrenaline also acts as a true counter to heroes with escape abilities (or the recipient of mobility sources like Rally's Compel or Tablet of Command) by forcing them to stay within Death's Halo.

+ Adrenaline also has a new playstyle that favours engaging multiple heroes at once, while aiming to catch and trap as many heroes as possible to prevent their escape & give his team an advantage.

+ In the process, Adrenaline lost his key frustration factors when his opponents were playing against him. These frustration factors include (but are not limited to): True Damage % based on Max Health with no actual counterplay, having too much uptime on his lane harass, and having way too many dashes available at once, gated only by Mana Cost rather than Mana Cost and cooldown.

+ Because of all these changes, Adrenaline's "energy" mechanic has been removed from the game. It allowed Adrenaline to have infinite harass in the laning phase & his skills had to be much weaker to compensate for that, and was overall too difficult to properly balance for the scope of the entire game. The "energy" mechanic just does not have a place in HoN where Health Sustain sources are costly to obtain in the laning phase.

*Now considered a Melee hero.
- Movement Speed increased from 290 to 310.
- Base Strength increased from 19 to 20.

- The Shard applies a base 15% Movement Speed Slow that lasts 2 seconds. Each Shard increases the slow by 5%, stacking up to 1/2/3/4 times.
- If the Shard hits 2 or more enemy heroes, the cooldown is reduced to 0.6 seconds and 60% of the Mana Cost is refunded.
- Reduces the cooldown of Rush by 1.5 seconds for each enemy hero hit.

Ability 3: Ember Shard (Reworked)
*Mana Cost:  70/80/90/100
*Cooldown: 15 seconds

- Activate to empower your next attack within 4 seconds with your Ember Shard, cleaving for 100% of your Attack Damage in a 250/300/350/400 radius, and Restrains + tethers affected enemy heroes for the next 1.8/2.2/2.6/3 seconds.
- If the distance between a tethered enemy hero and Adrenaline exceeds 750 units, the hero is pulled to Adrenaline. The enemy hero is Stunned & Restrained while being pulled towards Adrenaline, then Restrained for 1 second afterwards.
*Max pull distance of 1000 units.



Ability 4: Death's Halo (Reworked)

*Mana Cost: 100/150/200
*Cooldown: 100/90/80 seconds
*Radius: 750
- Activate to spawn Death's Halo around Adrenaline for 5/6/7 seconds, surrounding the area with shard walls.
- All units caught within Death's Halo cannot escape its area (including teleportation or "blink" skills of any kind).
*Units who do end up outside of Death's Halo will be forcefully teleported to a point back inside Death's Halo within half of this ability's radius.
- While active, Adrenaline gains 100% Slow Resistance, 100% Movement Speed, and 6/8/10 Agility and 1 Magic Armor per real hero caught (2x for enemy heroes).
- Adrenaline can cancel Death's Halo prematurely 2 seconds after it is cast.
- Death's Halo is destroyed if Adrenaline dies.
- Duration of Death's Halo is reduced by 1 second every time Adrenaline receives cumulative damage equal to 20% of his Max Health.

= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Blacksmith

Chaotic Flames
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Mana Cost changed from 60% of your current Mana to 33% of your Max Mana.
*Cooldown increased from 8 seconds to 30 seconds.

+ Blacksmith is receiving numerous buffs (mentioned later in the patch notes), so the boosted Chaotic Flames ability (Risky Cast) had to be more limited in its usage, as it was used as a "free" second proc of Fireball most of the time with generally unlimited availability.

_______________________________

Bramble

Chomp!
- Staff of the Master effect addition (to pre-existing):
*Cooldown reduced to 3 seconds.

_______________________________

Dampeer

Consume
- Staff of the Master effect (to pre-existing):
- Essence loss on death reduced from 4 to 3.

_______________________________________________

Electrician

Electric Shield
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Electic Shield is now a toggle.
*If Electrician's Mana reaches 0, the damage aura effect from Electric Shield stays active.

Cleansing Shock
- Staff of the Master effect (new):
*Mana Cost reduced to 0.
*Also spawns an ally area instance of Cleansing Shock when targeting an enemy (and an enemy instance of Cleansing Shock when targeting an ally).
*Effect radius around the target increased to 700.

_______________________________

Engineer

Energy Field
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
- Energy Field can now be thrown up to 800 units away from Engineer.
*Can still be double-activated to cast at your current position instead.
- Energy Field now procs its effects on affected enemy units immediately upon spawning.
- Now also deals 1.5% of the enemy hero's Max Health per second as Magic Damage.

+ Credits to ozilla for his suggestion on the official Heroes of Newerth forums!

_______________________________________________

Pyromancer

Blazing Strike
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Magic Damage increased from 650/875/1150 to 750/1000/1250.

_______________________________________________

Rhapsody

Protective Melody
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Rhapsody can now also attack and use abilities/items as usual during Protective Melody (in addition to allowing movement) without interrupting its effects.
*Stuns and Silences on Rhapsody will still interrupt Protective Melody and cancel it.

_______________________________________________

Witch Slayer

Silver Bullet
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Magic Damage increased from 600/800/1025 to 750/925/1100.

_______________________________________________



= Captain's Pick =

- The lobby host can now manually designate a team to get the First Ban before the game starts.
- Number of Rounds in the first Banning Phase increased from 2 to 3.
*Total number of Hero Bans in the first Banning Phase increased from 4 to 6.
- Hero Pick alternation method changed.
*Current method: 1-1-1-1-1-1 (total of 6 picks, 3 per team) for the first Hero Pick Phase, then 1-1-1-1 (total of 4 picks, 2 per team) for the second Hero Pick Phase.
*New method: 1-2-2 (total of 5 hero picks, 3 for the team that has First Ban and 2 for the other team) for the first Hero Pick Phase, then 2-2-1 (total of 5 picks, 3 for the team did not have First Ban and 2 for the other team) for the second Hero Pick Phase.
- Base time per Hero Pick Phase increased from 30 seconds to 35 seconds.
- Second Banning Phase now begins with the team that did not have First Ban at the start of the game.

+ These changes should reduce the advantages of the team that has the first hero pick and gives the team that goes second some opportunity to counter pick in the drafting phase of the game.
+ Overall, these changes allow for increased hero pick diversity in competitive tournaments!



= General =

- Towers: Bonus Attack Damage dealt to heroes changed from 20 to 20 + (1 per game minute elapsed).
- Heal Output increase mechanic now functions properly with Lifesteal.
*Examples of Heal Output increase mechanics: Sacrificial Stone, Rhapsody's new Arcane Hymn effects.



= Kongor =

- Now has a base 30% Slow Resistance.
- Enrage state: now also grants Kongor +30% Slow Resistance.
*These changes only apply for the Legion & Hellbourne Kongors on the Forests of Caldavar ("New") map.
- Bonus Siege Damage from the 2x Kongor Kill state now scales with time:
*Grows linearly from 20 minutes to 45 minutes.
*Minimum of 20% bonus Siege Damage, maximum of 60% bonus Siege Damage.


= Mid Wars =

- Hellbourne ramp that is closest to the Merrick's Rune spawn point has been adjusted to more closely resemble the angle that its Legion-side analog faces Merrick's Rune.
- Merrick's Rune can no longer be attacked in Mid Wars.
- Main Base Structure's Health Regeneration per second increased from 20 to 30 (when not damaged by an enemy within the last 10 seconds).




= Heroes =

Aluna

Emerald Lightning
- Attack Speed steal reduced from 50 to 20/30/40/50.
*The Attack Speed steal with Emerald Red's effect remains unchanged.

_______________________________________________

Arachna

Webbed Shot
- Magic Damage per second increased from 8/16/24/32 to 10/20/30/40.

Precision
- No longer grants True Strike to allies.

+ This change should help Arachna be a slightly better lane bully, without bringing back all of the frustration factors associated with the hero.
+ Precision's aura effect also overloaded the ability with utility. This effect is now transferred to Flint Beastwood's Dead Eye instead.

_______________________________________________

Artillery

LRM
- No longer deals reduced damage to non-hero units.
- Artillery is now Sighted for 1 second if LRM hits an enemy player-controlled unit.

Special Ammunition
- Bonus Cast Range on abilities reduced from 200/400/600/800 to 150/300/450/600.
- Movement Speed Slow applied by abilities changed from 15% to 13/16/19/22%.

+ Artillery's premise for being a long range hero has been one of the main causes of the frustration in playing against the hero.
+ Artillery was buffed in certain areas, while simultaneously reducing his max spell Cast Range values slightly until there is more time to properly address his hero design more thoroughly.

_______________________________________________

Blacksmith

Flaming Hammer
- Duration changed from 7.5 seconds to 5/6/7/8 seconds.
- Magic Damage per second rescaled from 10/20/30/40 to 20/25/30/35.
*Overall Magic Damage dealt (before factoring in the negative Magic Armor from this ability) changed from 75/150/225/300 to 100/150/210/280.

Frenzy
- Now grants an additional 10% Movement Speed for self.
- Now grants an additional 10/15/20/25 Attack Speed for self.

Chaotic Flames
- Chance for a strict 1x Multicast (i.e. no Multicast) reduced from 75/60/40% to 70/45/30%.
- Chance for a strict 2x Multicast increased from 25/20/30% to 30/35/35%.
- Chance for a strict 3x Multicast increased from 0/20/15% to 0/20/20%.
- Chance for a strict 4x Multicast remains unchanged at 0/0/15%.
*Overall long-term average Multicast multiplier increased from 2.05x to 2.2x.
*For Level 3 Chaotic Flames, average damage distribution for 1x/2x/3x/4x changed from approximately 20/29/22/29% to 14/32/27/27%, respectively.

+ These changes to Blacksmith should considerably bolster his early game performance, giving him more early game reliability, roaming power and laning power (and thus, increasing his competitive viability).
+ Additionally, these changes even open up other laning options and more dynamic roles for Blacksmith depending on how the game is going.
+ The changes to Chaotic Flames resulted in a more normalized damage distribution while keeping the chance mechanic/flavour on Blacksmith, and also reduced the likelyhood of getting only a 1x Multicast when Chaotic Flames is at max level.
+ Credits to MacroHard for assistance with the mathematics!

_______________________________________________

Bramble

Spore Breath
- Now heals Bramble for 0.5x the Magic Damage dealt to an enemy hero.
*Overhealing will grant Bramble a Shield state for 5 seconds. Max Shield Health of 400. Shield states are shared between abilities.

Chomp!
- Cooldown reduced from 12/10/8/6 seconds to 11/9/7/5 seconds.
- Now heals Bramble for 0.5x the bonus Magic Damage dealt by this ability.
*Overhealing will grant Bramble a shield state for 5 seconds. Max Shield Health of 400. Shield states are shared between abilities.

+ These changes should allow Bramble to remain more durable in the front lines and allow Ensnaring Shrubbery to be used on allies (instead of herself) more frequently.

_______________________________________________

Calamity

Dragon's Path
- Mana Cost increased from 40 to 45/50/55/60.

_______________________________________________

Dampeer

Consume
- Upon death, Essence count now goes to minimum of 1 if he has more than 1 Essence Count.
*Dampeer still loses his Essence if he only had 1 Essence before death.

_______________________________________________

Demented Shaman

Entangle
- Base Movement Speed Slow increased from 40% to 55%.
- Movement Speed Slow rescaled from 40/60/80/100% to 55/70/85/100%.
- Stun duration rescaled from 0/0.4/0.8/1.2 seconds to 0.3/0.6/0.9/1.2 seconds.

Unbreakable
- Mana Cost reduced from 150 to 100/110/120/130.

+ These changes help Demented Shaman a little bit more when played as a primary support.

_______________________________________________

Draconis

Draconic Defense
- Damage Reduction for Draconis reduced from 15/30/45/60% to 15/20/25/30%.
- Damage Reduction for ally buildings increased from 15/30/45/60% to 30/40/50/60%.

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master

Stagger
- Movement Speed bonus increased from 5/10/15/20 to 15/20/25/30.

Drink
- Cooldown reduction of Lunge and Stagger increased from 0.25 seconds to 0.5 seconds per 0.25 seconds channeled.
*Max cooldown reduction for Lunge and Stagger increased from 2 seconds to 4 seconds (if the skill was channeled for the full duration).
- Mana Cost reduced from 50 to 20.
- Healing from the natural expiration of a Drunk Charge increased from 5 Health to 6 Health.
- Extra Movement Speed Slow granted to Lunge increased from 20% to 30%.
- Extra Movement Speed granted to Stagger increased from 30 to 50.
- Now gains 10 Drunk Charges upon obtaining a Kill or an Assist on a real enemy hero.

+ Rather than addressing Drunken Master's other weaknesses, Drunken Master's Drink usage was made considerably more powerful so that he has access to Lunge & Stagger even earlier than before if he chooses to channel Drink mid-combat.

_______________________________________________

Empath

Illusory Veil
- Duration increased from 3 seconds to 3/3.4/3.8/4.2 seconds.
- Magic Damage per second reduced from 30/45/60/75 to 30/40/50/60.

Synergy
- Percentage-based Health Regeneration increased from 0.05/0.1/0.15/0.2% to 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4% of your Max Health per second.

_______________________________________________

Engineer
- Base Strength reduced from 22 to 20.

The Keg
- Magic Damage changed from 110/160/205/240 to 90/150/210/270.

Steam Turret
- Movement Speed Slow per charge changed from 3.5% to 2.5/3/3.5/4%.
*Max Movement Speed Slow changed from 35% to 25/30/35/40%.
- Push distance per bullet hit increased from 10/15/20/25 to 15/25/35/45.
- Magic Damage per bullet changed from 10/18/26/34 to 14/18/22/26.
*Max Potential Damage changed from 100/180/260/340 to 140/180/220/260 (though the realistic damage from this ability is pitiful due to how the mechanics work).

+ In practical situations, heroes only get hit by maybe 6-12 bullets, not 50. Steam Turret was never really used for its damage anyway and was more used for its zoning properties.
+ Furthermore, the damage has been shifted more towards The Keg as it is a skillshot that should yield high rewards, while Steam Turret should remain more focused as a utility spell.
+ In fact, Steam Turret's push effect is now much more formidable compared to before & has gained a big overall net buff in terms of utility.

Spider Mines
- Spider Mines now automatically detonate upon their initial placement if there is at least 1 enemy unit within its blast radius, dealing 0.75x Magic Damage when detonated in this manner.
- Spider Mines can now only be detonated manually once they have successfully been planted.
- Cooldown reduced from 8 seconds to 6.5 seconds.
- Max number of Spider Mines placed on the map at once reduced from 6 to 3/3/4/5.
- No longer has a Spider Mine stacking limit mechanic.

+ The Magic Damage on Spider Mines has been reduced when used as an on-demand nuke so that the ability is less of a stellar reliable ranged nuke compared to other support heroes.
+ Engineer had way more damage than other support heroes prior to these changes (he is secretly a hero with 3 nukes), so these changes put him on a more even power level relative to other support heroes, while frontloading more of the Magic Damage on The Keg (a skillshot) instead.
+ The overall changes here should let Engineer have a smoother distribution of Magic Damage between his abilities & over time, rather than having him get all the meaningful Magic Damage in a reliable manner only through Spider Mines.
+ With the changes to the max number of Spider Mines placed at once, there is no need for a stack limit mechanic any longer. By the time Engineer maxes out Spider Mines, there is a small time window where 5 Spider Mines can 1-shot an enemy hero, but this still needs considerable setup time & takes away from potential scouting uses for said time period. Once this short time period passes by, Engineer should use Spider Mines as a scouting tool and an on-demand nuke when it comes down to practical usage.
+ The changes to the detonate mechanic removes a great discrepancy between lower & mid skill level brackets vs. high skill brackets in terms of hero performance statistics, so it should be much easier to appropriately balance Engineer for all skill brackets from this time onward.
+ Overall, Engineer is now more in line with the damage progression of a ganker/nuker, while having support-like utility once he gets access to Energy Field and higher levels of Steam Turret.

_______________________________________________

Flint Beastwood

Hollowpoint Shells
- Bonus Physical Damage increased from 15/30/45/60 to 20/40/60/80.

Dead Eye
- Now grants allies within 900 radius a 25/50/75/100% chance to gain True Strike.
*Level 4 of the ability is considered to grant True Strike.

+ The True Strike aura mechanic was taken from Arachna's Precision to give Flint Beastwood a little bit more of a reason to be picked in games.
+ Flint Beastwood also got a small power boost on Hollowpoint Shells to keep up with the power level of today's meta.

_______________________________________________

Gauntlet

Gauntlet Blast
- Target scheme changed from Physical to SuperiorMagic.

_______________________________________________

Geomancer

Earth's Grasp
- Magic Damage per proc increased from 30/35/40/45 to 35/40/45/50.

Geo Stalk
- Radius increased from 1200/1500/1800/2100 to 1200/1800/2400/3000.

+ Slight number tweaks to increase Geomancer's niche, while not making him too obnoxious to deal with in the laning phase.

_______________________________________________

Glacius
- Intelligence gain per level increased from 2.9 to 3.0.

Tundra Blast
- Magic Damage changed from 110/150/180/210 to 110/170/190/210.

Ice Imprisonment
- Cast Range increased from 500 to 550.
- Mana Cost increased from 120/130/140/150 to 130/140/150/160.
- Magic Damage per second increased from 70 to 90.
*Max Magic Damage dealt by this ability increased from 105/140/175/210 to 135/180/225/270.

+ Glacius' early game is now even more powerful, at the cost of slightly increased mana consumption.
+ The hero has basic core fundamentals, mechanics and function, and competitively it is difficult to find reasons to pick him over other heroes.
+ The increased early game viability coupled with the Chilling Presence changes in the previous patch should make him competitively viable.

_______________________________________________

Grinex

Rift Stalk
- Armor debuff value changed from -0.8 Armor to -0.4 Armor.

_______________________________________________

Klanx

B.A.N.G.
- Enemies facing the flashbang now also receive a 15/20/25/30% Miss Chance for the duration.
- State duration reduced from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
*Tapering Movement Speed now tapers off a bit more slowly to compensate for the reduced slow duration.

+ This minor change gives Klanx a little bit more relevance & niche as a hero pick.

_______________________________________________

Lord Salforis

Life Tap
- Lifesteal reduced from 70/80/90/100% to 55/70/85/100%.

+ This small change should make Lord Salforis slightly less snowbally & slightly easier to deal with in the laning phase.

_______________________________________________

Magebane

Mana Combustion
- Base Mana Burn value increased from 6/12/18/24 to 15/20/25/30.

+ A small buff to make Magebane more relevant during the laning phase.

_______________________________________________

Madman

Stalk
- Mana Cost reduced from 70 to 60.

Barrel Roll
- Magic Damage increased from 100/160/220/280 to 100/165/230/295.

+ Madman was overnerfed in the previous patches. These changes should rebolster his early game while still toning down his late game.

_______________________________________________

Monarch

Crippling Pollen
- Projectile speed increased from 1000 to 1400 units per second.

+ Crippling Pollen was simply way too slow in today's meta. It is no longer as easily disjointable compared to before after receiving this change.

_______________________________________________

Monkey King

Illusive Dash
- The second dash will no longer automatically trigger when the timer expires naturally.

Vault
- Projectile speed for the initial jump on Vault (before impacting the enemy ) increased from 1000 to 1200.
- Projectile lifetime (before Monkey King lands, after Vaulting off the enemy) reduced from 0.6 seconds to 0.4 seconds.

+ These changes should allow Monkey King to minimize unwanted interactions & allow him to land slightly faster to enable him to autoattack foes sooner.

_______________________________________________

Moraxus

More Axes
- Max charges increased from 1/2/3/4 to 2/3/4/5.
- Cooldown reduced from 1.5 seconds to 1.25 seconds.

+ Moraxus is pretty dependent on doing well in his lane to maintain relevance throughout the game. Having even more axes available to him should help him maintain his relevance in the early/mid game.

_______________________________________________

Nitro

Ballistic
- Damage reduced from 10/16/22/28 to 6/12/18/24.
- Mana Cost increased from 10 to 15.

Blast Off
- Mana Cost increased from 90/100/110/120 to 100/110/120/130.

+ Nitro was a little bit too powerful when soloing the middle lane. These changes should make laning against her a little more bearable.

_______________________________________________

Oogie

Kindled Fury
- Cooldown increased from 7.5 seconds to 8 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Pebbles
- Base Intelligence reduced from 18 to 16.

Stalagmites
- Cooldown increased from 20/18/16/14 seconds to 21/19/17/15 seconds.

Chuck
- Cooldown increased from 10 seconds to 14/13/12/11 seconds.

+ Pebbles now regains a bit of his legacy laning phase weakness of having a limited mana pool. He can still cast both Stalagmites and Chuck without boosting his Mana Pool in the laning phase, but his mana pool will be nearly empty if he does this.
+ Chuck's cooldown has also been slightly increased to slightly reduce the frequency of harassing his lane opponent with just Chuck.

_______________________________________________

Prophet

Invigorate
- Heal increased from 75/100/125/150 to 80/120/140/160.

Shared Fate
- Cooldown reduced from 120/105/90 seconds to 90/80/70 seconds.

+ These changes should help Prophet more when played as a primary support hero.

_______________________________________________

Puppet Master

Puppeteer's Hold
- Mana Cost reduced from 110/130/150/170 to 100/115/130/145.

Puppet Show
- Mana Cost reduced from 125/140/155/170 to 115/130/145/160.

Whiplash
- Now also passively grants 10/20/30/40 Attack Speed.

Voodoo Puppet
- Leash Range reduced from 1500 to 1000.
- Voodoo Puppet's Max Health reduced from 500/750/1000 to 500/700/900.

+ These changes make Puppet Master just a tad less burst-oriented, while increasing his overall damage output over time and improving the availability of his spells.

_______________________________________________

Pyromancer
- Starting Attack Damage increased from 43-49 to 46-50.

Dragonfire
- Magic Damage increased from 80/120/160/200 to 80/130/180/230.
- Cooldown reduced from 10 seconds to 8 seconds.

Blazing Strike
- Magic Damage increased from 450/650/850 to 450/725/1000.

+ Pyromancer has been underperforming ever since the game's power level has been readjusted to be more reasonable. His scaling towards late-game and the availability of Dragonfire has been improved to help with this.

_______________________________________________

Qi

Enlightenment
- Mana Cost to reposition his Spirit Shredder reduced from 50 to 25.
- SuperiorMagic Damage per second dealt increased from 20/35/50/65/80% to 20/40/60/80/100% of an enemy hero's Extra Autoattack Damage per Second (DPS).
- Placement cooldown while Spirit Shredder is active reduced from 4 seconds to 4/3.5/3/2.5/2 seconds.

+ The increased damage change should amplify Qi's niche against strong autoattacking heroes without affecting his performance too much against heroes that have less items.
+ The extra ease of repositioning the Spirit Shredder around will make Qi more flexible in Spirit Shredder usage and placement as well.

_______________________________________________

Rampage

Ability 4: The Chains that Bind (Reworked)
*Range: 200
*Mana Cost: 150/200/250
*Cooldown: 100/85/70 seconds

- Binds the target to Rampage for 2.5/3/3.5 seconds and drags the target behind Rampage as he moves.
- The dragged target will take 25/35/45% of the distance they are dragged in Physical Damage.
- If Rampage and the dragged target gets separated by more than 600 units, the chains are broken.

+ Rampage's Greater Rhino lacked uniqueness and function when compared to other heroes.
+ By giving Rampage one of his iconic abilities back, he can once again controllably reposition a foe against their will.

_______________________________________________

Rhapsody
- Attack Range increased from 550 to 600.

Disco Inferno
- Enemies take 0.75x damage while they are moving on the Dance Floor (instead of taking no damage).
- Allies heal for 1.25x more while they are moving on the Dance Floor (instead of receiving no healing).
- Heal per second changed from 15/25/35/45 to 13/22/31/40.
- Rhapsody now has the option of attaching Disco Inferno to herself by pressing the ability hotkey for Arcane Hymn (hotkey "E" by default).

Arcane Hymn
- Now has 5 levels, with a base level of 1 (due to the Disco Inferno changes). At the base level, the ability will not do anything, but the active ability will be available if Disco Inferno is leveled.
- Radius increased from 500 to 900.
- Now also grants 15/20/25/30% increased Healing Output while affected by Arcane Hymn.
*Elaboration of mechanics: for Rhapsody, since Arcane Hymn applies to Rhapsody all the time, Disco Inferno will heal for an increased amount from Arcane Hymn.
*Another example: Jeraziah is affected by Arcane Hymn, and he casts Inner Light to heal an ally that is not affected by Arcane Hymn. Inner Light still gets its healing amplified, since the source of healing (Jeraziah) is affected by Arcane Hymn.
*An example where the healing output increase does not apply: Jeraziah is not affected by Arcane Hymn, and casts Inner Light on another hero that is affected by Arcane Hymn. Inner Light will not have its healing amplified, since the source of healing (Jeraziah) is not affected by Arcane Hymn.

+ Rhapsody has been falling behind in the meta as other supports proved to be more versatile and reliable than her, so her abilities have been adjusted to compensate for that.
+ Disco Inferno has a new option that properly rewards movement with Rhapsody & heroes in general, should the player choose to use that option.
+ Note that Arcane Hymn's aura radius will no longer match Protective Melody's radius. You will have to have more spatial awareness to know when Protective Melody will affect an ally!

_______________________________________________

Sapphire

Unstable Shard
- Shard Duration reduced from 10 seconds to 7 seconds.
- Cooldown reduced from 20 seconds to 17 seconds.

Crystallize
- Cast action time reduced from 1 second to 0.8 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Shadowblade
- Base Strength, Agility and Intelligence increased from 18 to 25.
- Strength, Agility and Intelligence growth per level reduced from 2.5 to 1.5.
- Starting Attack Damage readjusted from 50-53 to 55-58.

Gargantuan's Blast
- Bonus Armor increased from 0.75/1.5/2.25/3 to 3/6/9/12.
- Bonus Magic Armor increased from 0.75/1.5/2.25/3 to 1/2/3/4.
*The bonus Armor and Magic Armor now only lasts for 3.5 seconds after entering Gargantuan Form (instead of lasting for the full duration of Gargantuan Form).
*The bonus Strength still persists for the full duration of Gargantuan Form.

Feint's Siphon
- Now only steals Attack Damage when used against enemy player-controlled units.

+ Shadowblade had many frustration factors, and most of them stem from the long defensive bonuses from Gargantuan Form throughout the entire duration.
+ Buffing the Armor & Magic Armor bonus substantially while reducing the duration means that the player only gains the mass Armor/Magic Armor bonuses for a brief duration when using Gargantuan's Blast to damage & slow enemies.
+ Feint's Siphon no longer steals Attack Damage to avoid him speedfarming neutrals when he obtains a Runed Cleaver.
+ Ideally, Shadowblade should be a more true jack-of-all-trades hero, so his base stats have been substantially increased to bolster his early game performance, at the cost of his scaling (and thus, his carry capability) in the mid/late game.
+ Shadowblade should now perform much better as a semi-carry jack-of-all-trades hero, even in the laning phase (where his starting Attack Damage has been considerably increased, particularly in Soul's Sight form). Because of this change, he can be played as a support hero too!

_______________________________________________

Shellshock

Rolling Thunder
- Now allows you to cancel the roll by activating the ability again (without the need to have Staff of the Master).
- Allies can no longer enter Rolling Thunder if they are Stunned or Rooted.
*They can still enter Rolling Thunder if they are Restrained though!

_______________________________________________

Skrap

Summon Vorax
- Now gains 2 Attack Damage, 0.3 Armor and 20 Max Health per game minute elapsed when spawned.

+ These changes should help Vorax maintain relevance throughout the game as time passes by.

_______________________________________________

Wildsoul

Bear Form
- Now has a cooldown of 1 second once Wildsoul finishes morphing into Bear Form (reverting forms does not trigger the cooldown).
- Now has a Mana Cost of 20.

+ These changes are not intended to be nerfs, but rather to implement a mechanism to deter players from endlessly spamming the visual/sound effects.

- Magic Damage changed from 80/140/200/260 to 100/160/210/260.

Silver Bullet
- Magic Damage increased from 500/650/850 to 650/750/850.
- Cooldown changed from 105/80/55 seconds to 120/85/50 seconds.

+ Witch Slayer is now more differentiated from Pyromancer with a much higher early game damage on Silver Bullet (at the cost of an increased cooldown).
+ These changes also increase Witch Slayer's power when played as a support hero to be more comparable to other supports, while still not taking away his niche option to solo the middle lane (depending on the matchup) for a quick Portal Key to control the game's tempo.

_______________________________________________

Xemplar

Fractal Field
- Now only triggers on illusions within 900 radius of Xemplar.

Wall of Mirrors
- Magic Damage increased from 30/60/90/120 to 60/90/120/150.
- Each subsequent dash from the same cast instance after the third dash deals 0.7x Damage of the previous dash.

Schism
- For the first 5 seconds, the Schism illusions now only receive 66% of the damage they would normally receive (i.e. the same damage they would receive as if they were a regular hero).

+ Arcane Bomb is intended to counter illusion heroes, but Xemplar relies on his illusions quite a bit.
+ By making his Schism illusions less vulnerable to being killed right away, Xemplar should be able to output his damage more reliably before his Schism illusions die.

= Items =



New Item: Pegasus Boots
- Buildup: Post Haste (2500) + Recipe (2000) = 4500 Gold Total
- Has the same properties as Post Haste, with the following changes:
*Allows the user to also teleport to real ally heroes.
*Teleport target will not be disabled while the channel effect is happening.
*The teleport effect still cancels if the target hero dies before the channel ends.
*Base Movement Speed increased from 105 to 125.
*Max out-of-combat movement speed reduced from 45 to 35.

+ This item is meant to be a luxury upgrade from Post Haste, allowing a hero to teleport to another ally hero for global ganks and pushes without relying on the presence of a creep wave or ally creep.



Armor of the Mad Mage (Reworked)
- New buildup: Luminous Prism (1500) + Helm of the Victim (900) + Recipe (800) = 3200 Gold Total
- Passive bonuses: 8 Armor, 5 Health Regeneration per second, 18 Intelligence
- Passively applies -3 Magic Armor to enemies within 900 radius.
- Active: activate to grant yourself 20 Armor that tapers off over 6 seconds.
*Mana Cost: 75
*Cooldown: 45 seconds

+ Armor of the Mad Mage got its price point reduced so that it is a more viable midgame item that amplifies Magic Damage for the team while being near the middle of the teamfight.
+ As a result, its benefits were also slightly nerfed from before (and also had its self-purge effect removed).
+ However, its new buildup makes it easier to obtain & also grants some viable early Armor & Health Regeneration sustain. It is also no longer considered an item that uses an Activation Modifier.

_______________________________________________

Support-based Items

Nome's Wisdom
- Magic Armor granted by the aura reduced from 3 to 2.
- Armor granted by the aura reduced from 3 to 2.
- Max Shield Health reduced from 500 to 300.
- Shield duration reduced from 10 seconds to 7 seconds.
- Adrenaline no longer receives a penalty for this item's shield/heal mechanic (as the hero has been reworked such that it is unable to abuse this mechanic like before).

+ Nome's Wisdom was granting a little too much value for its price point and enabled deathball compositions a little too much. The changes should make it less of an all-around good item, while ensuring that it still gives a substantial increase in Magic Armor for the team.

Ophelia's Pact
- Cost reduced from 100 Gold to 80 Gold.
- Can now be purchased at the Observatory.
- Can now be placed in a Consumable Slot.

Orb of Zamos & Grave Locket
- State linger duration after getting out of range increased from 10 seconds to 12 seconds.

Ring of the Teacher
- Now requires a 50 Gold recipe.
*Total Cost increased from 500 Gold to 550 Gold.
*Can no longer be disassembled.
*As a result, the Total Cost of Lex Talionis, Abyssal Skull and Nome's Wisdom have also increased by 50 Gold.

Stormspirit
- No longer has Scarab in its buildup.
*Mana Regeneration bonus reduced from 150% to 125%.
- Now has Wind Whistle in its buildup instead.
- Now has a 100 Gold Recipe.
*Total Cost reduced from 2675 Gold to 2650 Gold.
*Can no longer be disassembled.

+ Just a minor component change, since Stormspirit already grants increased Movement Speed.
+ Wind Whistle is now a viable early game item for support heroes to take if they plan on building Stormspirit!

_______________________________________________

Lightning Item Changes

Thunderclaw
- Area Magic Damage on proc reduced from 90 to 85.

Hypercrown
- Attack Speed increased from 80 to 90.
*The Attack Speed for Hypercrown previously did not add up to the Attack Speed bonus granted by its parts (at the minimum). This has been corrected.
- Recipe Cost increased from 800 Gold to 1000 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 5600 Gold to 5800 Gold.
- Active ability can now only target ally heroes.

+ Farming items that actually have an upgrade should be expensive, as farming items are normally obtained for the purposes of farming & not to substantially increase your actual hero combat ability.
+ Furthermore, the active ability was used to accelerate farm in a split pushing manner, and was just doing too much. As a result, Thunderclaw and Hypercrown have received these minor (but important) changes so that their power and intention more closely match their Gold costs.

_______________________________________________

Lifesteal Item Changes

Elder Parasite
- Now also passively grants +10 Attack Damage.
- Passive Attack Speed bonus increased from 15 to 20.
- Damage Amplification for damage received for the active state reduced from 15% to 12%.
- Attack Speed bonus for the active state increased from 85 to 90.

+ Elder Parasite has been changed to be slightly more appealing to pick up as a midgame item that gives a burst of Attack Speed when required.

Whispering Helm
- +10 Attack Damage bonus removed.

+ Whispering Helm is still way too good at enabling carries to stack easily.
+ As the +10 Attack Damage came out of nowhere & Whispering Helm does not need to be any better at bolstering the hero's combat ability, it has been removed from the item.

Symbol of Rage
- Cooldown increased from 35 seconds to 50 seconds.
- Attack Damage bonus reduced from 20 to 10.

+ This change is propagated from Whispering Helm.

_______________________________________________

Icebrand Item Line Changes & Frostfield Plate Changes

Icebrand
- Movement Speed Slow increased from 15% to 20% for Melee wielders.

Frostburn and Frozen Light
- Movement Speed Slow increased from 25% to 30% for Melee wielders.

Dawnbringer
- Movement Speed Slow increased from 35% to 40% for Melee wielders.

Frostwolf's Skull
- No longer passively applies an Attack Speed Slow to affected enemy units.
- Active mechanics reworked: activating it once will spawn 2 Scouting Frost Wolves that seek out the nearest enemy heroes within radius, Sighting and Revealing them and applying a 20% Movement Speed Slow for 3 seconds.
*Radius: 5000
*Mana Cost: 25
*Cooldown: 50 seconds

- After activating it this way, can activate again within the next 50 seconds to send Dire Frost Wolves to impact nearby enemy player-controlled units, dealing 100 Magic Damage and applying a 50% Movement Speed Slow to enemies in radius for 4 seconds.
*Radius: 800
*Mana Cost: 0
*Cooldown: 30 seconds if the net cooldown is less than 30 seconds once the Scouting Frost Wolves have been sent out.

+ Frostwolf's Skull is now more differentiated from Frostfield Plate with a different active effect, as well as having a heavier focus on Movement Speed Slow.
+ Its scouting utility is a unique effect in the item pool, while still granting the same in-combat usage without directly tying it to the scouting part of the item.
+ Shoutout & thanks to Whyzozerious for the amazing visual effects on the Frost Wolves!

Frostfield Plate
- Strength bonus reduced from 6 to 3.
- Agility bonus reduced from 6 to 3.
- Armor reduced from 15 to 14.
- Attack Speed Slow Aura magnitude reduced from 20% to 10%.
- Active state's Movement Speed Slow reduced from 50% to 20%.
- Active state now also applies a 30% Attack Speed Slow (stacking additively with the aura's Attack Speed Slow).

+ Frostfield Plate is now much more focused on a heavy Attack Speed Slow on its active ability, at the cost of having less effective passive bonuses and a weaker Movement Speed Slow on the active state.
+ As a result, Frostfield Plate's usage and purpose is now even more differentiated from Frostwolf's Skull.

_______________________________________________

Lightbrand Item Line Changes

Lightbrand, Frozen Light, Searing Light, Dawnbringer, Grimoire of Power
- Searing effect is now also applied by non-Returned, non-DoT Damage.

Lightbrand
- Now also grants 6% non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal (2% against non-hero units).

Frozen Light and Searing Light
- Now also grants 10% non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal (3% against non-hero units).

Dawnbringer
- Now also grants 15% non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal (5% against non-hero units).
- Searing effect's Magic Damage per second per charge increased from 16 to 18.

Grimoire of Power
- Recipe Cost reduced from 800 Gold to 700 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 5100 Gold to 5000 Gold.
- Magic Damage Lifesteal no longer applies on Magic DoT effects.
- Non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal increased from 15% to 20% (7% against non-hero units).
- Ravenor no longer receives a penalty for this item's non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal.
- Active effect completely reworked:
*Activate to instantly dispel Debuffs and Stuns on self, and grant 100% Debuff and Stun Duration reduction for the next 1 second. Note that this will not protect you from continuous area effects (such as Chronos' Chronofield) or blue-bordered states like Succubus' Hold.
*Grimoire of Power can be activated even while Stunned or Perplexed.
*Cooldown: 70 seconds
*Mana Cost: 100


+ Grimore of Power's previous active effect (increased Magic Lifesteal) was too specific to heroes & it was hard to take advantage of that mechanic if you enter a battle at close to full HP & you need to use your important spells as soon as possible.
+ The item's active effect has been completely reworked to be more suitable for heroes that want to ensure their important spells/item usage go off even if they are caught by surprise (so long as they are not bursted down before having a chance to react).
+ This new effect is powerful enough such that it is generally usable on all heroes, but will benefit heroes with key abilities & items more often. The duration is short enough such that there is counterplay.
+ Finally, the Lightbrand item line now only works on non-DoT Magic Damage sources. This is due to some effects (like Mock of Brilliance) synergizing too well with a cheap item like Lightbrand.

_______________________________________________

Ward Changes

Ward of Revelation
- Reveal radius increased from 800 to 850.
*The "clearvision" initial reveal radius has been increased from 400 to 425.

Ward of Sight
- Vision radius increased from 1600 to 1700.

+ This change was partially done to address the issues with vision regarding the bottom rune.

_______________________________________________

Other Item Changes

Arcane Bomb
- Damage mechanic against illusions changed from Direct Health Removal to True Damage.
*This should not make a difference in most circumstances & primarily only makes a difference against Xemplar's Schism illusions.

Barbed Armor
- Returned Damage is now based on pre-mitigation damage (rather than post-mitigation damage).
- Returned Damage reduced from 80% to 65% of the pre-mitigation damage received.

Barrier Idol
- Component change in buildup: Major Totem (540 Gold) is now replaced with a Trinket of Restoration (350 Gold).
- Recipe Cost increased from 1060 Gold to 1250 Gold.
*Overall Cost remains the same at 3650 Gold.
- As a result of the component changes, no longer grants +5 Strength, Agility or Intelligence.
- Passive bonus Health Regeneration per second increased from 10 to 12.

Geometer's Bane
- Recipe Cost increased from 800 Gold to 900 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 5100 Gold to 5200 Gold.
- Cooldown increased from 50 seconds to 60 seconds.

Health Potion, Mana Potion, Bottle, Rejuvenation Potion
- Damage from sources that are non-boss, non-player controlled (NPC) neutral creeps (when not owned by a player) no longer dispel these effects while they are active.

Kuldra's Sheepstick
- If dispelled, the current duration of the Sheeped state is reduced by 80%, and the Sheeped state becomes unpurgeable for the remainder of its duration.

Spellshards
- Recipe Cost reduced from 725 Gold to 675 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 2050/2775/3500 to 2000/2675/3350.

Calamity
- Sunder's Vault side blockers now last the correct duration (they were lasting much longer than intended prior to the bugfix).

Electrician
- Electric Shield state (the non-SotM boosted version) now has charges to represent Shield Health.

Kinesis
- Stasis Smash no longer lifts allied player-controlled units.

Nymphora
- Teleport event for Nymphora now occurs at the same time as the teleport event for her allies, which fixes a corner case bug where Nymphora can cancel the last frame of her Teleport to teleport allies but not herself.
- Mass Teleport (when boosted by Staff of the Master) now properly spawns a level 4 instance of Volatile Pod (instead of spawning a Volatile Pod based on the level of Mass Teleport).

Version 4.8.6
-------------
22 September 2020



== New Content ==

New Pharaoh Avatar: Doge Anubis
- This higher-definition Pharaoh avatar was taken from the HoN China client. He also happens to look like a dog of the Shiba Inu species, which greatly resembles the iconic Doge!



== Design ==



= Hero Guides (NAEU/International Client Only) =

Every single default hero guide in-game has been updated with `WhatYouGot's hero guides! Thank you for providing a much-needed update for HoN's hero guides.

+ `WhatYouGot is a competitive-level HoN player, Twitch Streamer & Caster/Commentator for the recent HoN Tournaments & was also a competitive HoN player for Complexity Gaming back in 2015.

+ These updated hero guides are meant to act as a reliable base reference for new players and average players. As players get more experienced, they should adapt their skill builds & item choices to their current game as needed.

+ All of the old default hero guides written by Zlapped still exist, just not as the current default guides anymore. Zlapped's guides were solid in the past, but most have been outdated & been replaced with more up-to-date guides for today's HoN meta.



= Hero Rework - Qi =



Qi (Reworked)

+ The premise of Qi's Enlightenment dealing damage based on the target enemy's Attack Damage is fundamentally flawed on its own. Heroes naturally acquire Attack Damage throughout the game even if they don't have a single item (due to their primary attribute stat gains as they level up). Most heroes also tend to buy items that augment their primary attribute. The combination of these factors means that Qi's bonus damage output based on the target's Attack Damage will always be too weak or too strong against unfarmed or farmed heroes, or unable to be fairly manifested against the intended spectrum of heroes (farmed heroes with high autoattack damage output over time).

+ A more accurate & fair representation of an enemy's autoattack damage over time has been implemented for Qi's Enlightenment ability. This can simply be expressed as "Extra Autoattack DPS" (Damage per Second), and is the difference between the target's total autoattack DPS and their base autaottack DPS.

+ Mathematically: Extra_Autoattack_DPS = Total_Autoattack_DPS - Base_Autoattack_DPS

+ As a result, Qi now properly has a niche role in obliterating farmed autoattack enemy carries, while dealing below-average damage to underfarmed support heroes and not totally obliterating heroes in between that spectrum.

+ Qi's scaling is now much more dependent on his enemy's scaling as a result, so Qi's overall kit and numbers have been tailored towards being a Support Hero.

_______________________________________________

Crippling Puncture
- Cooldown increased from 12 seconds to 24/20/16/12 seconds.
- Movement Speed Slow and Disarm duration increased from 1/2/3/4 seconds to 1.6/2.4/3.2/4 seconds.
- SuperiorMagic Damage changed from 100/120/140/160 to 90/160/180/200.

A Thousand Cuts
- No longer applies an instance of non-Damage-over-Time (DoT) Ability Damage while the Spirit Shredder is travelling.
- The Spirit Shredder now has its DoT effect active starting from its initial launch (rather than only after reaching its initial destination).
- Initial Mana Cost changed from 90/100/110/120 to 100.
- Upkeep Mana Cost per second changed from 3/6/9/12 to (5/6/7/8 + 0.6/0.8/1/1.2% of your Max Mana).
- Magic Damage per second increased from 30/50/70/90 to 45/70/95/120.

+ A Thousand Cuts no longer deals an instance of non-DoT Ability Damage, as it was proven to provide too much burst damage with Enlightenment. It now only deals DoT damage to act as a zoning tool.

Enlightenment (Reworked)
- This ability has 5 levels & starts at level 1 at the start of the game.
- Passively deals 20/35/50/65/80% of an enemy hero's Extra Autoattack Damage per Second (DPS) as SuperiorMagic Damage for each instance of Ability Damage dealt to them. Extra Autoattack DPS is the difference between the target's Total Autoattack DPS and their Base Autoattack DPS.
*Damage over Time effects apply the correct amount of bonus damage per game frame (0.05 seconds).
- Staff of the Master: Qi's autoattacks bleed the enemy's Chi, dealing 1 SuperiorMagic Damage per second for 2 seconds. This counts as Ability Damage.

- Active: Target a position to reposition the Spirit Shredder from A Thousand Cuts (if it is out).
*Range: 700
*Cooldown: 4 seconds
*Mana Cost: 50

Ancestral Assault
- Mana Cost changed from 150/200/250 to 100/175/250.
- Number of instances reduced from 3/4/5 to 1/2/3.
- Impact interval between each instance increased from 0.1 seconds to 0.3 seconds.
- SuperiorMagic Damage changed from (20 + 60/67.5/75% of the target's Attack Damage) to 125.
- Now also applies a 1 second Disarm and Perplex to affected enemies upon impact.
*Note that Enlightenment is procced from Ancestral Assault's damage instances now.
- Damage no longer tapers based on the target's distance from your original cast location.

_______________________________________________



= Hero Rework - Drunken Master =



+ Drunken Master's ability usage in teamfights was too linear and 1-dimensional.

+ This rework aims to fix those issues by introducing factors of decision-making back to Drunken Master, as well as improving his ebb and flow in actual combat.

+ Healthy elements of the legacy Drink ability has been added back to Drunken Master to make this happen!

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master (Reworked)

Lunge
- Movement Speed Slow reduced from 20/30/40/50% to 15/20/25/30%.
- Cooldown changed from 14/12/10/8 seconds to 13/12/11/10 seconds.

Stagger
- Cooldown is now reduced to 0.8 seconds when Lunge is finished (instead of being refreshed when Lunge is first cast).

Ability 3: Drink (Reworked)
*Mana Cost: 50
*Cooldown: 20/16/12/8 seconds
*Channel Time: 2 seconds
- Channel to Drink, gaining 2/3/4/5 Drunk Charges and reducing the cooldown of Lunge and Stagger by 0.25 seconds per 0.25 seconds of channeling.
*Max of 16/24/32/40 Drunk Charges.
- Each Drunk Charge grants 1% Evasion and 1% Stun/Debuff Duration Reduction.
- Each Drunk Charge expires naturally every 2 seconds, healing you for 5 Health.
- When Lunge is used, consumes 6 Drunk Charges to add 20% Movement Speed Slow.
- When Stagger is used, consumes 4 Drunk Charges to add +30 Movement Speed.



+ Using Drink in combat sacrifices immediate attack-time-on-target and mobility for reduced cooldowns on Lunge and Stagger (i.e. increased mobility and damage after a short time). It also grants Drunken Master defensive and mobility bonuses, as Lunge and Stagger now consume Drunk charges.

+ To make Drink more interesting, Drink now has a low cooldown when the ability is maxed, allowing Drunken Master to consistently upkeep the Drunk charges in and out of combat.

+ Much like the first iteration of Drink, Drunken Master has more resilience during the laning phase with the healing over time from Drink.

+ Additionally, there is a slight delay before Stagger comes off cooldown after the Stagger-Lunge combo, allowing enemies to have a slightly larger time window for counterplay to 3 Point Strike.

_______________________________________________



= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Bushwack

Jungle Toxin
- Staff of the Master effect addition (to pre-existing):
*Now also grants Sight of the target.

_______________________________________________

Jeraziah

Sol's Blessing
- Staff of the Master effect addition (to pre-existing):
*Now also applies Protective Charm to affected ally non-building units for 2.5 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Lodestone

Shatterstorm
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Can now reactivate the ability after 2 seconds to proc Shatterstorm earlier than its regular detonation time.
*Lodestone's Armor and Magic Armor is now only reduced by 50% (instead of 100%).

_______________________________________________

Moon Queen

Moon Finale
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Beams no longer deal area damage.

_______________________________________________





= Report-A-Player (RAP) System =

Penalties will not include the action of muting players (due to multiple complaints about lack of necessary communication in the picking phase).
*Note that everything else in the RAP System for the NAEU/International Client remains the same.



= General =

- AFK Timer duration increased from 2.5 minutes to 3 minutes.



= Forests of Caldavar ("New") =

- The warding high cliff tower near the bottom rune on the Legion jungle side has been shifted very slightly to the southeast (makes ward vision of the Legion camps more consistent).
- The bottom rune has been shifted slightly towards the southeast in accordance with the previous change.
- The top-left corner of the map has been filled in with some untraversable lava (fixes some pathing issues around that area).



= Mid Wars =

- Merrick's Rune now spawns close to the first set of ramps southeast of the middle area of the river.
*This should allow Merrick's Rune to be more commonly contested compared to when it spawned at the boss lair.

- Backdoor Protection damage mitigation against heroes increased from 50% to 60%.
- Token of Sight now regenerates 15% Max Health and 15% Max Mana over 5 seconds for allies within 900 radius upon being obtained.
*This regeneration effect can stack up to 2 times.
*Dispels upon taking damage.

- Respawn time added per hero level increased from 0.5 seconds to 0.6 seconds.
- Respawn time added per missing ally non-base towers reduced from 3.75 seconds to 3.5 seconds.
*Overall, respawn time at level 25 increased from 12.5/16.25/20 seconds to 15/18.5/22 seconds.

+ This adjustment should make early game deaths feel somewhat impactful again, while still increasing respawn times slightly later on.



= Neutral Creeps =

- Medium Camp: total Experience per camp reduced from 185 to 170.
- Hard Camp: total Experience per camp reduced from 215 to 205.

+ The jungle changes allowed junglers to level up slightly too fast from the previous patch, so this should slow down their progression slightly.

The Experience changes to each individual neutral creep are as follows:
*Vagabond Assassin: 25 → 20 (this also reduces the Easy camp's experience containing the Vagabond Assassin to 140, which makes camp's Experience equal to every other Easy camp)
*Antlore Necromancer: 45 → 30 (not present in the "New" Forests of Caldavar map)
*Ebula: 55 → 50
*Pustula: 75 → 70
*Fire Ogre: 60 → 55
*Ice Ogre 65 → 60
*Alchemist Ogre: 60 → 55
*Wild Hunter: 93 → 85
*Wolf: 55 → 50
*Wolf Commander: 75 → 70
*Catman Soldier: 100 → 95
*Catman Champion: 115 → 110
*Goatar: 55 → 50
*Vulture Lord: 135 → 125
*Skeleton King: 135 → 125
*Vagabond Leader: 130 → 125

_______________________________________________





= Heroes =



Accursed

Fire Shield
- Mana Cost reduced from 100/110/120/130 to 100/105/110/115.

Sear
- In addition to its passive effects, now also has an active effect: activate to create a Searing Flame on the ground for 4 seconds, dealing 10/20/30/40 Magic Damage per second to enemies and Healing yourself for 8/12/16/20 + 0.4/0.6/0.8/1% of your Max Health per second.
*Cooldown: 24/22/20/18 seconds
*Mana Cost: 60
*Radius: 400

+ The Searing Flame will naturally proc Sear's negative effects for enemies and Sear's positive effects for Accursed when used in combat. This ability also further increases his survivability in the laning phase, particularly as a suicide hero.

_______________________________________________

Behemoth

Fissure
- Mana Cost reduced from 120/130/140/150 to 100/110/120/130.

_______________________________________________

Bombardier

Sticky Bomb
- Cast Range reduced from 800 to 650/700/750/800.
- Mana Cost increased from 95/105/115/125 to 105/115/125/135.

Air Strike!
- Magic Damage per strike increased from 200/275/350 to 220/290/360.

_______________________________________________

Bubbles
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 2.4 to 2.5.

_______________________________________________



== Forests of Caldavar ("New") ==

The main goal of the changes to the "new" Forests of Caldavar map is to make the viability of each laning setup choice to be more on par with one another, while retaining their own unique benefits and disadvantages.

- Legion bottom lane and Hellbourne top lane trees were rearranged significantly.
- Legion's southeastern most pull camp: a tree to the left of the camp (and to the right of the Observatory) has been removed to allow heroes to move through the nearby path.

+ There were far too many spots near the lane that made it nearly impossible to find a hero unless you were right next to the hero (and even then, sometimes it was nearly impossible to do so)., which led to unhealthy play patterns by solo unsafe lane heroes.
+ These changes address that issue, while still allowing for some niche hiding spots to be discovered. While this may appear to be a nerf to solo unsafe lane heroes, the jungle changes will more than compensate for that.



= Jungle Changes =

Hellbourne bottom lane - Medium pull camp (unsafe lane)
- Camp is now more accessible to the unsafe lane to be pulled into the lane
- Trees in this area now allow for better vision from the unsafe lane, while the vision of that camp ends up being more obscured for the safe lane
- Also reworked tree patch in this area to more closely mirror the Hellbourne side of the map.

Legion Ancients camp
- Now spawns a Hard neutral camp instead of an Ancients neutral camp.
- The other central Hard neutral camp has been replaced with a Medium neutral camp.
- A few trees have been removed to allow for more visibility & to allow for a slightly easier double stack.

Legion left-most Medium & Hard neutral camps
- Camps were shifted slightly towards the bottom-right.
- Leash range of these camps have been reverted to normal.
- Path between both camps are now more cleared of obstructions.
- Distance between both camps are now more similar to the Hellbourne equivalent (top-right-most) camps.
*These changes prevent the camps from being pulled towards the Legion middle lane, while simultaneously solving the difficulties of being difficult to double-stack these camps (due to a prior temporary fix).

Legion top lane - Medium pull camp (unsafe lane)
- Camp is now more accessible to the unsafe lane to be pulled into the lane.
- Trees in this area now allow for better vision from the unsafe lane, while the vision of that camp ends up being more obscured for the safe lane.

Hellbourne Ancients camp
- Now spawns a Hard neutral camp instead of an Ancients neutral camp.
- The other central Hard neutral camp has been replaced with a Medium neutral camp.
*This camp has also been rotated to face the new Hard camp more directly.

Hellbourne top-right-most Hard camp
- This neutral camp was shifted slightly downward.
- Leash range of the camp has been reverted to normal.
- This prevents the camps from being pulled towards the Hellbourne top lane.



+ Most of these jungle changes were done to balance the jungles between the Legion side and Hellbourne side, as well as make the top and bottom lanes slightly more equal in terms of the safe and unsafe lanes.

+ Overall, these changes (coupled with other changes in previous patches like the Merrick's Rune change) should make laning setup choices more balanced with regards to one another (any permutation/combination of 2-1-2 vs. 1-1-2-jungle and other dynamic variants involving partial/full roamers).

_______________________________________________



= Neutral Creep Changes =

Dragon
- Gold Bounty: 28-36 -> 35-45
- Physical Armor: 2-> 3
- Attack Damage: 55-> 60

Dragon Master
- Gold Bounty: 100-120 -> 130-145
- Magic Armor: 12 -> 10

Dreadbeetle
- Gold Bounty: 44-52 -> 55-65
- Physical Armor: 3 -> 6
- Base Attack Time: 1.4 -> 1.3

Dreadbeetle Queen
- Gold Bounty:  74-82 -> 90-105
- Physical Armor: 6 -> 10
- Base Attack Time: 1.4 -> 1.3

Predasaur
- Gold Bounty: 48-56 -> 60-70
- Physical Armor: 3.5 -> 6
- Max Health: 900 -> 1000

Predasaur Crusher
- Gold Bounty: 58-66 -> 70-85



+ The previous Gold Bounty nerfs have been reverted because there will now only be 1 Ancient Camp in the "new" Forests of Caldavar map.
+ Some stat adjustments were also made to make the camps more comparable to one another in terms of power, while still retaining their unique strengths and weaknesses.

_______________________________________________



= Mid Wars Changes =

The main goal of these changes to Mid Wars is to resolve some common frustrations encountered by players in this mode, while slowly leaning towards rewarding properly applied early/mid game aggressive plays & pushes.



- Zorgath and Transmutanstein return to Mid Wars!
*Say goodbye to Snotter Boss until next time!

- Matchmaking constraints for Mid Wars are slightly less relaxed, which should result in increasing the chances of getting a more enjoyable match.

- Earliest concede time availability reduced from 10 minutes to 5 minutes.
*This vote still requires 5 votes from a single team to actually pass (at least until 15 minutes where the usual reduction in required votes occurs).



- Backdoor Protection is now applied to the Melee and Ranged Barracks as well, and grants the Barracks 50% Damage Reduction against non-hero units while active (Main Base structure has 50% Damage Reduction against non-hero units by default already).
*Additionally, the Backdoor Protection state on the Main Base Structure and Barracks now also grants 50% Damage Reduction against heroes.

+ This change should help slow down uncoordinated & uncommitted attempts to end the game by backdooring to the point where the defending team can react and take action before the Main Base Structure falls.
+ The intention is not to remove backdooring (as it has its place to end the game when there are long stalemates for long periods of time), but to make it more of a committal and coordinated strategy to execute & introduce more opportunities to counterplay it. We understand that games ended abruptly without much means for counterplay makes for an anti-climatic ending, but having backdooring as an alternate game-ending option for long games is still necessary if the circumstances make it viable.



- Main Base Structure's Health Regeneration per second reduced from 50 to 20 (when not damaged by an enemy within the last 10 seconds).

+ This change partially addresses the frustration of getting the base to a low Health value, only to see it regenerate to full Health too quickly.


- Neutral camp composition has been changed (no longer spawns the traditional Hard neutral camps).
- Instead, now spawns 1 of the following camps:
*Dragon Master, Skeleton King, Vagabond Leader, Ice Ogre
*Predasaur Crusher, Vulture Lord, Minotaur, Wolf Commander
*Dreadbeetle Queen, Catman Champion, Vulture Lord, Wild Hunter

+ This change provides minimal disruption to the current map, while making the Gold & Experience value of the neutral camp more suitable for the mid & late game (rather than something that can be tackled in the early game by 1-2 heroes) and simultaneously discourages raw jungling early on (to keep the spirit of the map's name - Mid Wars).
+ Furthermore, this change allows Ophelia and Parasite to make use of Ancient Creeps if they have Staff of the Master.
+ This also allows these heroes more variety of creeps they can take control of in the early game, though the Ancient creep has to be cleared (or the camp needs to be stacked) for them to spawn more neutral creeps they can take control of in the early game.



- Respawn time equation has been changed.
*Old equation: Respawn Time (s) = 0.6 * Hero_Level
*New equation: Respawn Time (s) = (0.5 * Hero_Level) + 3.75 * (2 - Ally_Nonbase_Towers_Remaining)

+ The new respawn times allow for slightly faster early game respawns, while extending the respawn times by 3.75 seconds for each of your ally non-base towers that have been destroyed.
+ This gives pushing some tangible benefit in Mid Wars and disfavours turtling, without making early/mid game strategies too snowbally in nature.
+ Overall, this increases the respawn time at level 25 from 17 seconds (in all situations) to 12.5/16.25/20 seconds when 0/1/2 of your non-base towers are down. Further adjustments may be made in the future if this does not prove to be enough of a change.

_______________________________________________



== Design ==

- Max Disconnection Time reduced from 5 minutes to 4 minutes.
- AFK Timer duration reduced from 4 minutes to 2.5 minutes.
*AFK Warning time reduced from 3 minutes to 1.5 minutes.

+ While we understand that real-life situations & technical difficulties can happen once in a blue moon, they should not be happening frequently in any capacity.

+ Players should be active in the game for as much time as possible without disrupting the gameplay for others, and these changes help encourage players to make sure that they exhibit due diligence on their part to do so.



Fortification of Sol / Demonic Fortification
- Now goes on a 90 second cooldown when the game starts.
*Prevents players from accidentally triggering it at the start of the game while typing & transitioning from the hero pick lobby to the in-game map.

= Heroes =



Amun-Ra
- Agility growth per level reduced from 1.8 to 1.5.

- Stacks of Jungle Toxin applied to enemies within 300 radius of the target changed from 1 to 1/1/2/2.

Jungle Toxin
- Now Reveals affected targets.
*Note that this does not grant innate Sight of the target, but simply means that affected targets are detected as though they are not Stealthed.

_______________________________________________

Doctor Repulsor
- Starting Attack Damage changed from 47-57 to 50-54.
- Attack action time reduced from 500ms to 350ms.

Magnetic Contraption
- Cooldown increased from 4 seconds to 10/8/6/4 seconds.
- Cast backswing reduced from 400ms to 300ms.

Opposite Charges
- Mana Cost reduced from 100 to 70/80/90/100.
- Duration reduced from 1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds to 1/1.4/1.8/2.2 seconds.
- No longer applies a Movement Speed Slow to self upon use.

Electric Frenzy
- Now also resets your autoattack cooldown upon using an ability.
- Magic Damage increased from 30/50/70/90 to 40/60/80/100.
- Now grants +50 Attack Speed for the boosted attack (helps make this one attack launch faster).

Ludicrous Speed
- No longer resets your autoattack cooldown upon use (since Electric Frenzy does that now).
- No longer Stunned while travelling.
- Instead, Doctor Repulsor is Perplexed (unable to use items) while travelling.
*This means that Doctor Repulsor can autoattack & cast spells while Ludicrous Speed is active!
*The Perplexed state remains on Doctor Repulsor for 0.8 seconds after exiting Ludicrous Speed.
- Magic Damage dealt per 100 units travelled reduced from 15/20/25 to 6/12/18.
- Max Magic Damage dealt per instance reduced from 300/400/500 to 200/300/400.
- Cooldown increased from 0.3 seconds to 0.4 seconds.



+ Doctor Repulsor has an odd power curve due to the nature of Ludicrous Speed. His laning presence has been virtually non-existent because of his long range ganking potential at level 6, so some raw damage was taken away from Ludicrous Speed, while giving him much better tools for laning & the early game in general.

+ These changes do weaken the raw damage output through his ultimate alone, but the autoattack reset mechanic on Electric Frenzy opens up new combo routes & makes micromanaging his mana pool for Ludicrous Speed even more important. Player mechanical skill in terms of mouse speed & accuracy, cancelling the cast backswing of his abilities, as well as taking advantage of some returning mechanics on Ludicrous Speed will optimize the effectiveness of Doctor Repulsor, while simultaneously retaining options for counterplay (e.g. the Perplex state on Doctor Repulsor means item usage is not immediately available to him after exiting Ludicrous Speed).

+ Overall, these changes favour Doctor Repulsor more in terms of getting that long range ganking power spike at level 6 (which is his unique strength compared to every other hero), without frontloading the power on Ludicrous Speed itself. The changes make him less effective when played as a raw carry if relying on the damage from Ludicrous Speed, and more of a core hero that focuses on capitalizing on the uniqueness of his ganker-carry role and playstyle.

+ We deeply apologize for the inconvenience.

_______________________________________________



== Design ==



= General =

- HoNiversary Sublime Name Colour's ranking in the chat channels has been increased. Its ranking is directly below the Champions of Newerth name colour, which is below all volunteer & staff name colours.



= Mid Wars =

- MMR for Mid Wars: each player's MMR is now visible once again.
*A bug occurred in the old UI that caused Legion's MMR to not be visible in all modes, so this change had to be reverted (for better or worse, depending on your viewpoint).

- Legion base's Melee and Ranged Barrack positions have swapped (and the base received some slight rearrangements too).
- Merrick's Rune now spawns in front of the boss lair and travels upstream.

- Bottle: Merrick's Rune now properly gets stored in the Bottle if you try to use an empty Bottle on it (as opposed to directly right-clicking the rune).
*The behaviours are now consistent between both methods of storing Merrick's Rune in the Bottle.

Version 4.8.4
-------------
2 June 2020



== HoNiversary ==



Heroes of Newerth celebrates its 10th anniversary with its players!
*Note that the listed changes only apply for the NAEU/International Client & that the SEA Client will have their own events.

- Earn prizes by logging in & playing HoN!
- Participate in community events on our official forums with us to celebrate this special milestone in history!
- HoNiversary events will take place from June 2, 2020 to July 2, 2020.

== New Content ==



New Aluna Avatar: Aluna (CN)
- This higher-definition Aluna avatar was the default avatar in the HoN China client. It has finally made its way to the rest of Newerth!



== Design ==



= Hero Rework - Nitro =



Nitro (Reworked)

+ Nitro's fire-while-moving mechanic as a primary mechanic is conceptually broken/imbalanced and frustrating to deal with in this game. This concept simply does not work in HoN in a fair manner.
+ This results in making her high-highs too distinct from the other levels of performance, and also drastically punishes the average player who plays her while disproportionately rewarding veteran Nitro players.
+ Additionally, she was statistically impossible to balance, both in terms of power, performance and frustration levels.
+ The rework maintains her hit-and-run mechanic and makes her kit much more fun overall, but allows both the Nitro player and other players in the game to interact with her more fairly.
+ She even gets to keep a fun & balanced version of her fire-while-moving mechanic on her ultimate as a nice bonus!



- Now has default auto-attack behaviour.

- Main (out-of-game) soundtrack has been updated to the Apollo theme.



= General =

Ranked Pick
- Now has a 5 second delay when transitioning from the hero banning phase to the first hero pick of the game.
- Max number of hero bans that can take place at the end of the banning phase increased from 4 to 6.

Fire Ogre
- Max Mana increased from 0 to 200.

*Range: 800
*Target an ally unit to apply Immolating Flames to it for 30 seconds. Immolating Flames deals 20 Magic Damage per second in a 200 radius around the affected target.

= Runes =

New Rune: Merrick's Rune
- Replaces Refreshment Rune in the game.

- Grants 35 Gold, plus 2 Gold per minute of elapsed game time (excluding the pregame time).

*Gives the user of Ioyn Stone the gold benefits of the rune immediately when this occurs. The gold benefits do not transfer to the Ioyn Stone charges.

+ Merrick's Rune is intended to replace Refreshment Rune. It solves the feeling of utter disappointment, as the player who gets Merrick's Rune will have much more of a compensation if they do not end up obtaining the primary rune that spawns.



= Mid Wars =

- Snotter Boss has returned to Newerth to replace Transmutanstein & Zorgath (for now)!
- Merrick's Rune now spawns at the top of the river and floats down towards the boss lair.

_______________________________________________

Scout

Disarm
- State duration reduced from 2.5 seconds to 2 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Shadowblade

Gargantuan's Blast
- Mana Cost changed from 90 to 75/85/95/105.
- Magic Damage reduced from 60/120/180/240 to 55/110/165/220.
- Now suffers a 20% Damage Penalty and -15% Movement Speed while this form is active.

Feint's Siphon
- Mana Cost changed from 90 to 75/85/95/105.
- Magic Damage reduced from 60/120/180/240 to 55/110/165/220.
- Now receives an additional 8% Damage while this form is active.

+ Shadowblade's kit has a little too much early game power and survivability in high level play, making his snowball a little too difficult to deal with.

+ Additionally, the Gargantuan Form is still overly strong compared to the other forms, as maintaining the benefits of the base form while also having such a good early game survivability tool that scales well into the game was a bit much. The intention of the Gargantuan Form is durability first & foremost, and not to grant Shadowblade high damage upkeep while doing so.

+ Feint Form was also a little bit too good against enemy carries. In general, Gargantuan Form and Feint Form now have small downsides to them so the player thinks a little bit more about their form shifting usage.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

 

New Item: Spyglass
- Given to all players at the start of the game.
- Activate to bring up the targeting cursor.
*Using Spyglass will transform it into harmless confetti at the target location.
*Sells for 0 Gold (can be sold though).
*Cannot be dropped.
*Expires after 90 seconds.

+ This item solely exists for the select few players who are experiencing the AoE indicator lag, as there has not been a common factor among the tiny fraction of players that experience this issue & nobody has been able to pinpoint what causes this issue.
+ Previously known as one of the most useless items in HoN's history, Spyglass makes its way back into Newerth and finally becomes useful to a small subset of players!

_______________________________________________

Jade Spire
- Bonus Max Mana reduced from 400 to 300.
- Bonus Mana Regeneration reduced from 150% to 115%.
- Mid Wars only change: bonus Range granted to abilities increased from 100 to 150.

+ Jade Spire was giving way too much additional benefits upon completion for only 600 Gold. Toning down these benefits makes the item more in line with the benefits other items receive upon their completion.

_______________________________________________

Orb of Zamos
- New recipe: Minor Totem (50) + Recipe (250) = 300 Gold Total (Total Cost unchanged from before)
- Bonus Strength, Agility and Intelligence reduced from 2 to 1.
- Gold bonus for creep kills is now halved if the distance between the linked heroes is greater than 1500.

Grave Locket
- Now requires a 25 Gold Recipe.
*Total Cost increased from 775 Gold to 800 Gold.
- Bonus Agility reduced from 5 to 2.
- Gold bonus for creep kills is now halved if the distance between the linked heroes is greater than 1500.
- Bonus Experience granted to the linked hero per enemy creep kill reduced from 15 to 10.
- Now only grants Bonus Experience to the linked hero for an enemy creep kill if the linked hero is not within the experience range of the creep kill.

+ These changes should help reduce the performance gap between solo laners in the unsafe lane ("suicide lane heroes") and the support hero of a dual lane.

+ Furthermore, both of these items were a little too efficient. They should now be considered less of a "must-buy" item as a laning support.

+ In particular, Grave Locket was literally generating free experience if both laning heroes are in lane and killing creeps. This issue has been remedied with this change.

_______________________________________________

Refreshing Ornament
- New recipe: Trinket of Restoration (350) + Minor Totem (50) + Recipe (150) = 550 Gold Total
- Bonus Agility reduced from 5 to 2.

Astrolabe
- Bonus Agility reduced from 8 to 5.
- Recipe cost increased from 400 to 510.
*Total cost increased from 1440 to 1550.

+ Agility carry heroes who picked up Refreshing Ornament for an efficient laning item that also granted them Agility, while upgrading the item into Astrolabe as an extremely cost-efficient survivability item that also granted them Agility was way too powerful.

+ Changing the components closer to how they were in the past should remedy this issue by quite a bit. Astrolabe was also too cost-efficient for what it did, so a slight cost nerf is also warranted.

_______________________________________________

Barrier Idol
- State duration increased from 8 seconds to 10 seconds.
- State duration is now doubled for non-hero units.

Nome's Wisdom
- Bonus Magic Armor from the aura increased from 2 to 3.
- Component priority changed from "Mystic Vestments -> Ring of the Teacher -> Manatube -> Recipe" to "Ring of the Teacher -> Manatube -> Mystic Vestments -> Recipe".

+ Magic Armor items for pushing and teamfights were a little lacking. These changes give them a little bit more utility and flexibility for their intended function.

_______________________________________________

Spellshards (Reworked)
- Component Buildup: Perpetual Cogwheel (1325) + Recipe (825) = 2150 Gold Total.
- Can be upgraded up to 2 times (max of 3 total levels).
*Total Gold Cost is therefore 2150/2975/3800 Gold.
- Passively grants 150/175/200% Mana Regeneration and 5/10/15 Intelligence.
- Passively grants +10/15/20% Spell Damage against non-hero units.
- Passively grants 30/45/60% Magic Armor Penetration.

+ This rework to Spellshards makes it less universally amazing for all heroes, while also properly gating its power behind a reasonable price point.
_______________________________________________

Ringmail
- Armor reduced from 5 to 4.
- Cost reduced from 550 to 450.

Lex Talionis
- Recipe Cost increased from 100 Gold to 200 Gold.
*Total Cost remains unchanged from before (1150 Gold).
- Bonus Armor reduced from 6 to 5.
- Armor addition/reduction when applied to an ally/enemy reduced from 6 to 5, respectively.
*Armor reduction on self when this occurs is also reduced from 6 to 5.

Sol's Bulwark
- Recipe Cost increased from 1000 Gold to 1050 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 1550 Gold to 1500 Gold 
*This is due to the reduction of cost in Ringmail.

Daemonic Breastplate
- Total Cost reduced from 5250 Gold to 5200 Gold.
*This is due to the reduction of cost from both Ringmail and Sol's Bulwark.

Ultor's Heavy Helm
- Recipe cost increased from 1000 Gold to 1025 Gold.
- Total cost reduced from 3725 Gold to 3650 Gold.
*This is due to the reduction of cost from Ringmail.

Shield of the Five
- Recipe Cost increased from 200 Gold to 300 Gold.
*Total Cost remains unchanged from before (800 Gold).
- Passive effect changes: Armor reduced from 5 to 4.
- Active effect changes:
*Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
*Duration reduced from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.
*Effects are no longer doubled for the first 10 seconds of the state duration.
*Armor granted to ally units and structures reduced from 2 to 1.

Plated Greaves
- Passive effect changes: Armor reduced from 7 to 6.
- Active effect changes:
*Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
*Duration reduced from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.
*Effects are no longer doubled for the first 10 seconds of the state duration.
*Armor granted to allied heroes and structures reduced from 2 to 1.5.
*Ally non-hero units now also receive the Armor bonus.

+ These Armor items were a little too efficient early on, and Plated Greaves and Shield of the Five did a little too much as well. These adjustments should put them more in line with the game's general power level.

_______________________________________________

Hypercrown
- Recipe Cost increased from 700 Gold to 800 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 5500 Gold to 5600 Gold.

Icon of the Goddess
- Mid Wars only changes:
*Gift of the Goddess state: Healing per second reduced from 15 to 7.5.
*Gift of the Goddess state: Mana Regeneration per second reduced from 20 to 10.
*Max charges reduced from 25 to 15.

Twin Blades
- Bonus Mana Regeneration reduced from 75% to 50%.
- Damage on the secondary attack reduced from 100% to 80%.

_______________________________________________

Ward of Revelation
- Initial placement that gives vision of enemy Wards in fog: radius of this mechanic reduced from 800 to 400.
*The default reveal radius of 800 remains untouched.

+ Counterwarding is a pretty one-dimensional choice when placing them: simply cover the most area possible.

+ By reducing the radius of the intiial placement that gives vision of existing enemy Wards that are in fog, players now have to choose more carefully between optimal area coverage of possible enemy ward locations, or getting suboptimal coverage while revealing ward on high ground.

+ Players can still technically gain the both these benefits if they have a hero that can grant temporary clearvision of wards, or if they purchase the Flying Courier from the item shop.

= Heroes =

Circe
- Copying an enemy hero that has Genjuro with Twisted Visage will now ensure that the Genjuro in Circe's mimic's inventory starts off with 2 charges.

Moira
- Fixed a rare frame-perfect bug where abilities on the real Moira did not properly go on cooldown if the mimic from Ephemeral Forge dies on the exact same frame the ability is finished its cast action time.

Nitro
- Tesla Cannon Nitro's visual and sound effects have been properly fixed & touched up, and has been re-enabled (and will stay this way, assuming there are no other issues with the avatar).

Lodestone
- Rocket Drill no longer sends Kinesis to the bottom-left corner of the map if Kinesis copies it (via Thoughtsteal), receives a morph state after casting Rocket Drill has already been sent out (e.g. Kuldra's Sheepstick) and uses the second activation of Rocket Drill within the same cast instance.

Tarot
- Bound by Fate now properly applies the reduced level of Magic Damage & Stun if the main target is a non-hero unit and if that unit dies before the projectile impacts.



= Items =

Version 4.8.3
-------------
7 April 2020



== Design ==



= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =



Gemini

Fire and Ice
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
- Cooldown reduced from 45 seconds to 20 seconds.
- Now also splits Gemini into a third elemental form, Light.
*Light's life essence is still tied to the other elementals, i.e. Gemini still dies if either Fire, Ice or Light dies.
*For Fire & Ice, their Rebirth ability now also requires Light to be nearby for them to all recombine.
*For Fire & Ice, their Rebirth ability now sets Gemini's Health and Mana percentage to the highest of all 3 elemental forms.

+ Fire gains a subability:
- Ability 3b - Together in Bright Spirit: After a 3 second cast time, teleports Fire to Light's location.
*Shares cooldown with Together in Spirit.
*Default activation hotkey: D

+ Ice gains a subability:
- Ability 3b - Together in Bright Spirit: After a 3 second cast time, teleports Ice to Light's location.
*Shares cooldown with Together in Spirit.
*Default activation hotkey: D



+ Light's abilities are as follows:

- Ability 1 - Light Breath: Unleashes a cone of light that deals 100/175/250 Magic Damage and applies a 40/60/80% Miss Chance to enemies for 3 seconds.
*Has the same general parameters (Cast Range, Mana Cost, Cooldown) as its analog ability on Fire and Ice.

- Ability 2 - Light Fang: Shoots Light at target enemy, making him invulnerable during the process. Deals 60/120/180 Magic Damage and applies a 0.5 second Stun.
*Has the same general parameters (Cast Range, Mana Cost, Cooldown) as its analog ability on Fire and Ice.

- Ability 3a - Together in Fiery Spirit: After a 3 second cast time, teleports Light to Fire's location.
*Cooldown: 30 seconds
*Shares cooldown with Together in Icy Spirit.

- Ability 3b - Together in Icy Spirit: After a 3 second cast time, teleports Light to Ice's location.
*Cooldown: 30 seconds
*Shares cooldown with Together in Fiery Spirit.
*Default activation hotkey: D

- Ability 4 - Rebirth / Lightning Form:
*Passive: While 1200 units away from enemy heroes, Light becomes an an agile elemental also known as Volt, gaining 10/50/10000% Movement Speed. Max Movement Speed is set to 750. This effect is disabled for 12 seconds when Light uses an ability, attacks, or takes damage.
* Active: Activate to begin casting for 1.25 seconds. Upon finishing the cast, recreates Gemini at the current location with Health and Mana Percentages equal to the highest of Fire, Ice, and Light. Disabled if Fire, Ice and Light are more than 300 units apart.

+ Light also serves as an agile scouting elemental. This rewards skilled Gemini players that can micromanage all 3 elementals optimally, all while taking advantage of Light's out-of-combat speed to scout and set up a constant global roaming presence in the late game.

_______________________________________________

Geomancer

Crystal Field
- Staff of the Master effect addition (to pre-existing):
*Now also applies a 35% Movement Speed Slow to enemies within 600 radius before the initial explosion occurs.

_______________________________________________

Magebane

Flash
- Staff of the Master addition (new):
*Enemy units within 600 radius of Magebane's blink location have Mana Feedback applied to them for 6 seconds. Active abilities cast by these affected targets will deal 110% of that ability's Mana Cost to the caster.

Mana Rift
- Staff of the Master effect change (complete replacement of the previous one):
*Mana Rift's Damage dealt to the main target now propagates to 1 other enemy hero within 800 radius with 60% power.
*Enemies affected by Mana Rift within the inner 225 radius will not be affected by this new effect, and will still take full damage.

_______________________________________________

Martyr

Sol's Conviction
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Allows Martyr to cast the ability on willing ally heroes within 600 Cast Range.

_______________________________________________

Ophelia

Command
- Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
*Ability now only grants 0.25x the Movement Speed bonus to her Ancient creeps.

_______________________________________________

Soul Reaper

Demonic Execution
- Staff of the Master effect addition (to pre-existing):
*Demonic Execution's Damage dealt to the main target now also chains to enemy heroes within 500 radius with 60% power each time, up to 5 times.
*The chaining effect cannot apply to a hero that is already hit by the same cast instance of Demonic Execution.

_______________________________________________

 

= General =

- On the hero pick screen while selecting an avatar, clicking on an unowned avatar's "Need Coins" button will now redirect you to the HoN Store.
*If players are lacking Gold Coins to purchase an avatar, they can now navigate to the HoN Store and click on the "Buy Coins" button there. 

Forests of Caldavar ("New") - Neutral Creeps
- Slightly reduced the max chase time & chase distance for the 2 bottom-left-most Legion neutral camps and the top-right-most Hellbourne neutral camp.
*Greatly mitigates the unintended behaviour of pulling the nearest lane creeps with these neutral camps.
*Note: this change also makes the double stack timings a bit more strict.
*This change is considered to be temporary until proper map changes can be made.

Towers
- Aggro check duration against enemy-player-controlled units that attack nearby ally heroes reduced from 2 seconds to 1 second.
*This does not affect the actual aggro duration of the tower against the targeted unit (i.e. after the tower has locked onto the target). It only affects the time in which it checks whether it needs to switch aggro or not.
*Mitigates cases where you damage an enemy hero when you are outside the tower's attack range & then proceed to go within tower range to last hit a creep and having the tower lock onto you.
*A more thorough remedy may be investigated in the future when time permits.

_______________________________________________

 



= Heroes =



Adrenaline

Rush
- Max number of Dread Stacks reduced from 12/20/28/36 to 15/20/25/30.

Death's Halo
- Number of Dread Stacks applied changed from 12/24/36 to 14/22/30.

+ When playing against Adrenaline, it is simply too frustrating to be almost literally any hero with any amount of farm and be solo killed by Adrenaline with relatively less effective items as a solo ganker with maybe just a touch of ally support.
*No, hanging back and waiting to react with Stormspirit is not the ideal counterplay against Adrenaline, as it is not always feasible nor reliable.

+ With these changes, Adrenaline's solo kill potential requires a little bit more ally assistance or proper itemization.

_______________________________________________

Andromeda
- Attack Range increased from 450 to 475.

Void Rip
- No longer deals a negligible amount of damage (to interrupt Portal Key, for example).

_______________________________________________

Bushwack

Crippling Dart
- Movement Speed Slow duration reduced from 1.5 seconds to 1.25 seconds.
- Cooldown reduction of this ability per autoattack lowered from 0.4 seconds to 0.2 seconds.

Side Step
- Mana Cost increased from 20 to 30.

_______________________________________________

Berzerker

Mark of Death
- Attack Speed bonus against marked targets changed from 40 to 30/40/50/60.

_______________________________________________

Corrupted Disciple

Electric Tide
- Minimum Magic Damage per hit reduced from 40/60/80/100 to 35/55/75/95.
- Maximum Magic Damage per hit reduced from 90/140/190/240 to 70/110/150/190.

Corrupted Conduit
- Cast Range reduced from 600 to 550.
*Leash range adjusted accordingly.

_______________________________________________

Electrician

Cleansing Shock
- True Damage dealt to summoned enemy units rescaled from 1000 to 700/850/1000.

_______________________________________________

Ellonia

Flash Freeze
- Total Magic Damage is now capped at 550.

+ When coupled with Staff of the Master, Flash Freeze's effect on her Absolute Zero ability dealt excessive area damage if Frosted Stacks were accumulated on enemies ahead of time (particularly when coupled with ally crowd control).
+ Implementing a cap on the total Magic Damage in these circumstances & for long wars of attrition will prevent Ellonia from 1-shotting a hero with a large number of Frosted Stacks on them.

_______________________________________________

Engineer
- Primary Attribute changed from Agility to Intelligence.
- Agility growth per level reduced from 2.3 to 2.1.
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 2.1 to 2.5.

+ Engineer is underperforming and most of his item build consists of Intelligence items. This small change should help his performance significantly by increasing his damage by mid/late game compared to other support heroes.

_______________________________________________

Goldenveil

Perch & Plunge
- Plunge: delay before Goldenveil lands to apply the Magic Damage & Stun increased from 0.8 seconds to 0.85 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Hellbringer

Summon Malphas
- Malphas Max Health reduced from 900/1400/1900 to 900/1350/1800.
- Malphas Attack Damage reduced from 80/125/170 to 80/120/160.
- Malphas Health Regeneration per second reduced from 15/20/25 to 10/14/18.

_______________________________________________

Ichor

Transfusion
- Link duration reduced from 6 seconds to 4.5/5/5.5/6 seconds.

Saint's Blood
- Base Damage Reduction lowered from 10/15/20/25% to 3/6/9/12%.
- Damage Reduction increase per debuff active on Ichor increased from 8% to 8/9/10/11%.
- No longer requires the damage to exceed 15% of Ichor's Current Health for the Damage Reduction to take place.
- Max total Damage Reduction changed from 40/45/50/60% to 25/35/45/55%.

_______________________________________________

Martyr
- Strength growth per level increased from 2.4 to 2.5.
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 2.4 to 2.5.

Retribution
- Mana Cost reduced from 95/105/115/125 to 90/100/110/120.

_______________________________________________

Moira

Shards of Harkon
- Cast Action Time reduced from 300ms to 200ms.
- Cast Time reduced from 600ms to 200ms.

Ephemeral Forge
- Cooldown increased from 60/55/50/45 seconds to 95/90/85/80 seconds.
- Max duration increased from 10/14/18/22 seconds to 12/18/24/30 seconds.

+ The cooldown of Ephemeral Forge caused Moira to be able to assist allies in ganks and teamfights without any risk far too frequently.
+ Increasing the cooldown of Ephemeral Forge will force Moira to use this ability more wisely. Otherwise, she will have to put herself at risk more often if she uses this ability too haphazardly.

_______________________________________________

Myrmidon
- Attack Range increased from 450 to 500.

Weed Field
- State duration increased from 1/1.33/1.6/2 seconds to 1/1.4/1.8/2.2 seconds.

Magic Carp
- Mana Cost reduced from 95/100/105/110 to 80/90/100/110.
- Now applies a 30/40/50/60% Movement Speed Slow for 0.6 seconds if the target is not moving at the time of impact.

+ The change to Magic Carp only ever so slightly makes it easier to ensure that Weed Field hits your intended target. The change looks stronger on paper than it is in practice.

_______________________________________________

Pandamonium

Flick
- Cast Range reduced from 400 to 350.
- Mana Cost changed from 50 to 60.

_______________________________________________

Parasite

Infest
- Infested creep's bonus damage received from player-controlled enemy units reduced from +50% to +25%.
- Consume subability can no longer be used while the Infested creep is Silenced or Stunned.

+ Parasite should not be able to break out of crowd control early from his Infested creep. This was a big oversight for most of the HoN's lifetime.
+ As compensation for this adjustment, the previous nerf has been toned back.

_______________________________________________

Predator

Venomous Leap
- Now also applies a Restrain effect for the first 2 seconds of the debuff.

Terror
- Movement Speed bonus granted to attackers increased from 15% to 20%.
- Buff duration granted to attackers increased from 3.5 seconds to 4.25 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Qi

Ancestral Assault
- Damage now deals less damage as the distance becomes larger between the target and the ability's original cast location.
*300 Range and below: starts at 100% Damage
* Max Range: scales down to 40% Damage

_______________________________________________

Sapphire

Unstable Shards
- Area Magic Damage upon hitting the Unstable Shard increased from 110/115/120/125% to 115/120/125/130% of the Attacker's Attack Damage.

_______________________________________________

Scout

Electric Eye
- Effect type of the Silence application changed from SuperiorMagic to Magic.
- Silence duration reduced from 3/4/5/6 seconds to 2/3/4/5 seconds.
- Placement restriction for the minimum distance from a tree increased from 75 units to 100 units.
- Cast Range increased from 100 to 150.
- Vision radius and reveal radius changed from 800 to 700/800/900/1000.
- Proximity detection range (for enemies to see the Electric Eye) increased from 200 to 300.

+ Scout's Electric Eyes have been a fundamentally broken tool since his inception. The ability has been made more reasonable (and more importantly, unable to pierce Magic Immunity as a non-ultimate ability) and simultaneously made less aggravating to play against if the Scout player uses Electric Eyes mostly to block neutral camps from spawning, while focusing more on the scouting/vision aspect of the Electric Eyes.

+ If Scout needs buffs in the future, he will receive them in the appropriate parts of his kit. Until then, these adjustments should make playing against Scout a little more bearable without affecting his actual power much.

_______________________________________________

Skrap

Mousetrap
- Magic Damage upon exploding increased from 80/100/120/140 to 80/105/130/155.

Zoomerang
- Magic Damage per hit increased from 60/80/100/120 to 60/85/110/135.

Unleash Vorax
- Gold Bounty amount increased from 40% to 65% when Vorax kills an enemy (non-player-controlled) creep and if Skrap is more than 1500 units away from Vorax.
*The distance value has also increased from 1000 units to 1500 units in the above change.

_______________________________________________

Tarot

Far Scry
- State type changed to Debuff (making it purgeable).
*State will still be unable to be transferred by abilities like Parasite's Facehug for technical reasons.

Bound by Fate
- Tether state type on both affected targets changed to Debuff  (making it purgeable).
*State will still be unable to be transferred by abilities like Parasite's Facehug for technical reasons.
*Purging 1 of the debuff states on a target will purge the tether state on the other target.

Luck of the Draw
- Critical Strike chance increased from 20% to 25%.

 _______________________________________________

Thunderbringer

Lightning Rod
- Procs now occur when Thunderbringer deals Ability Damage to a target (rather than when he casts a spell).
- Bonus Magic Damage based on the target's Current Health now deals 0.5x damage if the target is farther than 1000 units from Thunderbringer.

 _______________________________________________

Torturer

Chain Reaction
- Mana cost reduced from 120/135/150/165 to 105/120/135/150.

Impalement
- Mana cost reduced from 115/130/145/160 to 95/115/135/155.

_______________________________________________

Warchief
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 2.7 to 2.8.

_______________________________________________

Wildsoul

Summon Booboo
- Swipe: cooldown increased from 8 seconds to 11 seconds.
*This change also applies to Wildsoul while in Bear Form.

_______________________________________________

Xemplar

Fractal Field
- Each subsequent explosion affecting a target past the third explosion within the last 2 seconds now deals 0.7x Damage of the previous explosion.

_______________________________________________

 

 

= Items =



Blight Stones
- Cast Range increased from 100 to 135.
*This is mostly to resolve issues where players cannot seem to target trees near them.
*Keep in mind that sometimes the tree actually does end up falling & a charge on Blight Stones is properly consumed, but you will not see the tree fall in fog. This is an intended feature, as it prevents enemies from seeing when trees fall in fog.

Bound Eye
- Active effect now also reveals all enemy gadgets in its detection radius (even those in fog).

Shrunken Head
- Cooldown increased from 65 seconds to 75 seconds.

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

 

= General =

- Fixed a MMR exploit where players intentionally made every player's MMR behave as 1500 (and making everyone's MMR change +/- 5 for the game) by switching game modes before entering the matchmaking queue.
*Players who abused this bug should be ashamed of themselves.
*Remember to report big game exploits to the Senior Game Masters (SGMs) when possible! The players will be suspended in these scenarios.

- MvP Show/Hide button no longer displays at the beginning of a subsequent game.

- Water tile definitions near the middle lane ramps were adjusted to more accurately match the water's visual location for the purposes of abilities dependent on the presence of a water tile (e.g. Riptide's In My Element ability).



= Heroes =

Berzerker
- Chain Spike timer is now properly readjusted when the initial state is applied on an enemy (particularly when used against an opponent that reduces debuff durations).

Geomancer
- Slightly increased sight radius while Geo Stalk is active.
*Fixes a corner case scenario where Geomancer cannot see a target within the Geo Stalk detection radius at very specific angles.

Grinex
- Fixed a minor tooltip error with Nether Strike when the Staff of the Master effect is on Grinex.

Hellbringer
- Malphas can no longer attack buildings if Hellbringer isn't within 925 units.
- Summon Malphas visual effects at the target location are now displayed properly for Batllebringer and Arimane the Pit Lord alternate avatars.

Lodestone
- Lodestone Plates visuals now show the appropriate cosmetic for all alternate avatars.
- Lodestone Plates visuals are now properly shown when the ability timer reaches 0.

Moira

= Items =

- The following items can no longer be transferred to other units or be dropped on the ground to fix an exploit where more than 1 completed of the item can be owned by a particular player in their hero's inventory at any given time:
*Alchemist's Bones
*Jade Spire
*Restoration Stone

+ Note that there is still 1 way to attempt to bypass this, but the player is in for a gold loss surprise (and/or just flat out being inefficient) if they try to go that far. So just don't even try to exploit this, it will only hinder you.
*This was an unintended exploit. Please use RAP to report players if you see them repeatedly performing any kind of exploit that bypasses an item's intended limit per player.



Flying Courier
- Can no longer perform a gold pooling exploit by dropping a shareable item with charges & picking it up again with the Flying Courier to change the item's ownership.
*This was an unintended exploit. Please use RAP to report players if you see them continuously performing any kind of gold pooling exploit in the future, as they will be suspended if they continue to do so.

Hypercrown
- Damage is now sourced properly from the original owner of Hypercrown if the procs from its Charged Up state ends up damaging & killing enemy units.
*This properly gives gold bounty to Hypercrown's owner when the Charged Up state kills an enemy unit.
