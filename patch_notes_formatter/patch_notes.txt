New Pharaoh Avatar: Doge Anubis
- This higher-definition Pharaoh avatar was taken from the HoN China client. He also happens to look like a dog of the Shiba Inu species, which greatly resembles the iconic Doge!



== Design ==



= Hero Guides (NAEU/International Client Only) =

Every single default hero guide in-game has been updated with `WhatYouGot's hero guides! Thank you for providing a much-needed update for HoN's hero guides.

+ `WhatYouGot is a competitive-level HoN player, Twitch Streamer & Caster/Commentator for the recent HoN Tournaments & was also a competitive HoN player for Complexity Gaming back in 2015.

+ These updated hero guides are meant to act as a reliable base reference for new players and average players. As players get more experienced, they should adapt their skill builds & item choices to their current game as needed.

+ All of the old default hero guides written by Zlapped still exist, just not as the current default guides anymore. Zlapped's guides were solid in the past, but most have been outdated & been replaced with more up-to-date guides for today's HoN meta.



= Hero Rework - Qi =



Qi (Reworked)

+ The premise of Qi's Enlightenment dealing damage based on the target enemy's Attack Damage is fundamentally flawed on its own. Heroes naturally acquire Attack Damage throughout the game even if they don't have a single item (due to their primary attribute stat gains as they level up). Most heroes also tend to buy items that augment their primary attribute. The combination of these factors means that Qi's bonus damage output based on the target's Attack Damage will always be too weak or too strong against unfarmed or farmed heroes, or unable to be fairly manifested against the intended spectrum of heroes (farmed heroes with high autoattack damage output over time).

+ A more accurate & fair representation of an enemy's autoattack damage over time has been implemented for Qi's Enlightenment ability. This can simply be expressed as "Extra Autoattack DPS" (Damage per Second), and is the difference between the target's total autoattack DPS and their base autaottack DPS.

+ Mathematically: Extra_Autoattack_DPS = Total_Autoattack_DPS - Base_Autoattack_DPS

+ As a result, Qi now properly has a niche role in obliterating farmed autoattack enemy carries, while dealing below-average damage to underfarmed support heroes and not totally obliterating heroes in between that spectrum.

+ Qi's scaling is now much more dependent on his enemy's scaling as a result, so Qi's overall kit and numbers have been tailored towards being a Support Hero.

_______________________________________________

Crippling Puncture
- Cooldown increased from 12 seconds to 24/20/16/12 seconds.
- Movement Speed Slow and Disarm duration increased from 1/2/3/4 seconds to 1.6/2.4/3.2/4 seconds.
- SuperiorMagic Damage changed from 100/120/140/160 to 90/160/180/200.

A Thousand Cuts
- No longer applies an instance of non-Damage-over-Time (DoT) Ability Damage while the Spirit Shredder is travelling.
- The Spirit Shredder now has its DoT effect active starting from its initial launch (rather than only after reaching its initial destination).
- Initial Mana Cost changed from 90/100/110/120 to 100.
- Upkeep Mana Cost per second changed from 3/6/9/12 to (5/6/7/8 + 0.6/0.8/1/1.2% of your Max Mana).
- Magic Damage per second increased from 30/50/70/90 to 45/70/95/120.

+ A Thousand Cuts no longer deals an instance of non-DoT Ability Damage, as it was proven to provide too much burst damage with Enlightenment. It now only deals DoT damage to act as a zoning tool.

Enlightenment (Reworked)
- This ability has 5 levels & starts at level 1 at the start of the game.
- Passively deals 20/35/50/65/80% of an enemy hero's Extra Autoattack Damage per Second (DPS) as SuperiorMagic Damage for each instance of Ability Damage dealt to them. Extra Autoattack DPS is the difference between the target's Total Autoattack DPS and their Base Autoattack DPS.
*Damage over Time effects apply the correct amount of bonus damage per game frame (0.05 seconds).
- Staff of the Master: Qi's autoattacks bleed the enemy's Chi, dealing 1 SuperiorMagic Damage per second for 2 seconds. This counts as Ability Damage.

- Active: Target a position to reposition the Spirit Shredder from A Thousand Cuts (if it is out).
*Range: 700
*Cooldown: 4 seconds
*Mana Cost: 50

Ancestral Assault
- Mana Cost changed from 150/200/250 to 100/175/250.
- Number of instances reduced from 3/4/5 to 1/2/3.
- Impact interval between each instance increased from 0.1 seconds to 0.3 seconds.
- SuperiorMagic Damage changed from (20 + 60/67.5/75% of the target's Attack Damage) to 125.
- Now also applies a 1 second Disarm and Perplex to affected enemies upon impact.
*Note that Enlightenment is procced from Ancestral Assault's damage instances now.
- Damage no longer tapers based on the target's distance from your original cast location.

= Hero Rework - Drunken Master =



+ Drunken Master's ability usage in teamfights was too linear and 1-dimensional.

+ This rework aims to fix those issues by introducing factors of decision-making back to Drunken Master, as well as improving his ebb and flow in actual combat.

+ Healthy elements of the legacy Drink ability has been added back to Drunken Master to make this happen!

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master (Reworked)

Lunge
- Movement Speed Slow reduced from 20/30/40/50% to 15/20/25/30%.
- Cooldown changed from 14/12/10/8 seconds to 13/12/11/10 seconds.

Stagger
- Cooldown is now reduced to 0.8 seconds when Lunge is finished (instead of being refreshed when Lunge is first cast).

Ability 3: Drink (Reworked)
*Mana Cost: 50
*Cooldown: 20/16/12/8 seconds
*Channel Time: 2 seconds
- Channel to Drink, gaining 2/3/4/5 Drunk Charges and reducing the cooldown of Lunge and Stagger by 0.25 seconds per 0.25 seconds of channeling.
*Max of 16/24/32/40 Drunk Charges.
- Each Drunk Charge grants 1% Evasion and 1% Stun/Debuff Duration Reduction.
- Each Drunk Charge expires naturally every 2 seconds, healing you for 5 Health.
- When Lunge is used, consumes 6 Drunk Charges to add 20% Movement Speed Slow.
- When Stagger is used, consumes 4 Drunk Charges to add +30 Movement Speed.



+ Using Drink in combat sacrifices immediate attack-time-on-target and mobility for reduced cooldowns on Lunge and Stagger (i.e. increased mobility and damage after a short time). It also grants Drunken Master defensive and mobility bonuses, as Lunge and Stagger now consume Drunk charges.

+ To make Drink more interesting, Drink now has a low cooldown when the ability is maxed, allowing Drunken Master to consistently upkeep the Drunk charges in and out of combat.

+ Much like the first iteration of Drink, Drunken Master has more resilience during the laning phase with the healing over time from Drink.

+ Additionally, there is a slight delay before Stagger comes off cooldown after the Stagger-Lunge combo, allowing enemies to have a slightly larger time window for counterplay to 3 Point Strike.

= Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes =

Bushwack

Jungle Toxin
- Staff of the Master effect addition (to pre-existing):
*Now also grants Sight of the target.

_______________________________________________

Jeraziah

Sol's Blessing
- Staff of the Master effect addition (to pre-existing):
*Now also applies Protective Charm to affected ally non-building units for 2.5 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Lodestone

Shatterstorm
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Can now reactivate the ability after 2 seconds to proc Shatterstorm earlier than its regular detonation time.
*Lodestone's Armor and Magic Armor is now only reduced by 50% (instead of 100%).

_______________________________________________

Moon Queen

- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Beams no longer deal area damage.

_______________________________________________





= Report-A-Player (RAP) System =

Penalties will not include the action of muting players (due to multiple complaints about lack of necessary communication in the picking phase).
*Note that everything else in the RAP System for the NAEU/International Client remains the same.



= General =

- AFK Timer duration increased from 2.5 minutes to 3 minutes.



= Forests of Caldavar ("New") =

- The warding high cliff tower near the bottom rune on the Legion jungle side has been shifted very slightly to the southeast (makes ward vision of the Legion camps more consistent).
- The bottom rune has been shifted slightly towards the southeast in accordance with the previous change.
- The top-left corner of the map has been filled in with some untraversable lava (fixes some pathing issues around that area).



= Mid Wars =

- Merrick's Rune now spawns close to the first set of ramps southeast of the middle area of the river.
*This should allow Merrick's Rune to be more commonly contested compared to when it spawned at the boss lair.

- Backdoor Protection damage mitigation against heroes increased from 50% to 60%.
- Token of Sight now regenerates 15% Max Health and 15% Max Mana over 5 seconds for allies within 900 radius upon being obtained.
*This regeneration effect can stack up to 2 times.
*Dispels upon taking damage.

- Respawn time added per hero level increased from 0.5 seconds to 0.6 seconds.
- Respawn time added per missing ally non-base towers reduced from 3.75 seconds to 3.5 seconds.
*Overall, respawn time at level 25 increased from 12.5/16.25/20 seconds to 15/18.5/22 seconds.

+ This adjustment should make early game deaths feel somewhat impactful again, while still increasing respawn times slightly later on.



= Neutral Creeps =

- Medium Camp: total Experience per camp reduced from 185 to 170.
- Hard Camp: total Experience per camp reduced from 215 to 205.

+ The jungle changes allowed junglers to level up slightly too fast from the previous patch, so this should slow down their progression slightly.

The Experience changes to each individual neutral creep are as follows:
*Vagabond Assassin: 25 → 20 (this also reduces the Easy camp's experience containing the Vagabond Assassin to 140, which makes camp's Experience equal to every other Easy camp)
*Antlore Necromancer: 45 → 30 (not present in the "New" Forests of Caldavar map)
*Ebula: 55 → 50
*Pustula: 75 → 70
*Fire Ogre: 60 → 55
*Ice Ogre 65 → 60
*Alchemist Ogre: 60 → 55
*Wild Hunter: 93 → 85
*Wolf: 55 → 50
*Wolf Commander: 75 → 70
*Catman Soldier: 100 → 95
*Catman Champion: 115 → 110
*Goatar: 55 → 50
*Vulture Lord: 135 → 125
*Skeleton King: 135 → 125
*Vagabond Leader: 130 → 125

Accursed

Fire Shield
- Mana Cost reduced from 100/110/120/130 to 100/105/110/115.

Sear
- In addition to its passive effects, now also has an active effect: activate to create a Searing Flame on the ground for 4 seconds, dealing 10/20/30/40 Magic Damage per second to enemies and Healing yourself for 8/12/16/20 + 0.4/0.6/0.8/1% of your Max Health per second.
*Cooldown: 24/22/20/18 seconds
*Mana Cost: 60
*Radius: 400

+ The Searing Flame will naturally proc Sear's negative effects for enemies and Sear's positive effects for Accursed when used in combat. This ability also further increases his survivability in the laning phase, particularly as a suicide hero.

Fissure
- Mana Cost reduced from 120/130/140/150 to 100/110/120/130.

+ Goldenveil is now less dependent on trees & not as hard-countered by items like Arcane Bomb.

+ Goldenveil players who find Plunge unreliable now have a choice of using it while not Perched on a tree, sacrificing range, raw damage & stun duration for sheer reliability and speed.

Golden Apple
- Passive Mana Regeneration per second reduced from 0.3 to 0.25.
