<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Blood Hunter</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Hemorrhage</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Radius increased from 250 to 325.

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Ophelia</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Command</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Movement Speed bonus granted to an ancient creep changed from 0.25x of the original bonus to 10.

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Prisoner</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Prison Break</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Activation on self now reduces the effect delay by 50%.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Prior to this patch, casting on self did not actually make the effect instant, so it is both a bugfix and a balance change.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Staff of the Master Visuals </span>=
<br />The following heroes now have proper Staff of the Master effect visuals when they receive the state from Master's Legacy:
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Arachna
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Artesia
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Blacksmith
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Calamity
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Corrupted Disciple
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Draconis
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Ellonia
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Engineer
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Gauntlet
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Jeraziah
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Keeper of the Forest
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Legionnaire
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Lord Salforis
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Madman
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Martyr
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Monarch
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Pestilence
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Prisoner
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Rally
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Rhapsody

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Tempest
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Zephyr
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Forests of Caldavar </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Ally player-controlled non-hero units near the Level 3 Towers will have unitwalking for the first 2 minutes.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> All NPC Neutral creeps now have Push Immunity for the first 2 minutes.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes will address specific unintentional behaviours from being leveraged too early on in the laning phase of the game for 1 team to get a high reward without reasonable counterplay (or without an appropriate level of risk).</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These unintentional behaviours can still be used after the first 2 minutes. By that time, all players have more appropriate tools and levels available to them to have reasonable counterplay.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes have no impact on regular gameplay.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Neutral Creeps </span>=
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Catman Champion</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Mana Regeneration per second granted to allies from the aura reduced from 2 to 1.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Minotaur</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Attack Speed bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 20 to 15.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Vagabond Leader</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Health Regeneration per second granted to allies from the aura reduced from 5 to 4.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage dealt by Ground Pound reduced from 170 to 150.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Vulture Lord</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Armor bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 2 to 1.
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Mid Wars </span>=
<br />Banning Draft
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Ban phase time increased from 15 seconds to 30 seconds per round.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Hero selection time increased from 20 seconds to 40 seconds per round.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Time period after all heroes have been picked (but before the game starts) increased from 20 seconds to 30 seconds.
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Heroes </span>=
<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Adrenaline</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Shard Blast</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mana Cost changed from 55/70/85/100 to 50/70/90/110.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Magic Damage reduced from 80/120/160/200 to 80/115/150/185.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown reduced from 4 seconds to 3 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown reduction for Rush decreased from 1.5 seconds to 1 second per enemy hero hit.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> When the Shard hits 2 or more enemy heroes, the mechanics have changed.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Old mechanic:
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Cooldown is reduced to 0.5 seconds and 60% of the Mana Cost is refunded.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> New mechanic:
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Cooldown is now reduced by 0.75 seconds, and Mana Cost on the ability is reduced by 10/15/20/25.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This effect stacks up to 2 times and lasts for 10 seconds.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Ember Shard</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Max pull distance reduced from 1000 units to 800 units.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Regular distance at which the enemy unit stops from Adrenaline (when travelling to him) increased from 100 units to 150 units.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Death's Halo</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Strength per real hero caught reduced from 4/6/8 to 3/4/5.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Still 2x the value for enemy heroes.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer gains 2 bonus Attack Damage per real hero trapped.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Adrenaline's Shard Blast was a little too explosive and lopsided when encountering multiple enemy heroes, and proved to have too much downtime in teamfights when not hitting 2+ enemy heroes.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Shard Blast is still intended to perform extremely well when fighting multiple heroes, so its bonus effects will be more fair, sustained and consistent after these changes.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Artillery</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>LRM</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Percentage of Attack Damage bonus on each LRM rocket changed from 7/14/21/28% to 7/12/17/22%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Artillery is now Sighted for 1 second if LRM hits an enemy unit (instead of just player-controlled enemy units).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> If you hit a neutral creep, the neutral creep's team will have sight of Artillery (not the opposing Legion/Hellbourne team).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Cast Range reduced from 1200 to 1100.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now uses the correct range increase value from Special Ammunition.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Mortar Shot</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Cast Range reduced from 1200 to 1100.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now uses the correct range increase value from Special Ammunition.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Homing Missile</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Cast Range reduced from 1200 to 1100.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now uses the correct range increase value from Special Ammunition.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Prior to this patch, these 3 abilities were still using the values prior to 4.9.0, despite the fact that they were intended to be reduced.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Despite this, Artillery's performance has been significantly higher than intended, so another small nerf was added on top of the intended cast range reduction. This should make his range less polarizing to deal with.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Blood Hunter</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Hemorrhage</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Initial Superior Magic Damage increased from 200/300/400 to 250/375/500.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Superior Magic Damage taken per unit travelled increased from 35/55/75% to 40/60/80%.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Prior to this patch, the values in the tooltip were displayed as 30/45/60% - this change both corrects the tooltips and buffs the ability slightly.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Calamity</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Funeral Pyre</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Agility gain state on self duration increased from 1.25x to 1.5x the original state duration.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Circe</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Doppelganger</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mana Cost changed from 100/85/70/55 to 60/70/80/90.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Cthulhuphant</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Obliterate</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Using this ability will no longer interrupt your order queue.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Maddening Revenge</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Attackers now also have -30/40/50/60% Healing Received for 0.1 seconds upon attacking Cthulhuphant.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Receiving damage from Cthulhuphant's front will grant Cthulhuphant 5/10/15/20 Health Regeneration per second for 2 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The Health Regeneration effect and Return Damage now only have 0.33x effectiveness on Cthulhuphant's illusions.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Although Cthulhuphant is in a generally good state, Maddening Revenge does not have really have much going for the ability at the moment.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Granting Cthulhuphant slightly more durability and preventing regular lifesteal from being a hard counter to this ability will allow this ability to be more worth leveling during the game.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Deadlift</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Onslaught</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cast effect type changed from Magic to Physical.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Devourer</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Starting Armor increased from 1.16 to 2.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Draconis</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Fiery Barrage</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Dragonflame now only spreads the flames once from Ablaze (instead of spreading it 4 times).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Magic Damage per 4 seconds increased from 5/10/15/20 to 20.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Damage rate increase per charge reduced from 100% to 70%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Max charges reduced from 8 to 5/6/7/8.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Damage multiplier against heroes increased from 0.5/0.8/1.1/1.4x to 0.8/1/1.2/1.4x.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Draconis has the ability to take camps using the unique mechanics of Fiery Barrage (where you damage different enemies to maximize damage by spreading the fire) without taking damage. However, it was too easy to quickly reach the max potential damage of Fiery Barrage against stacked neutral camps by using Dragonflame.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes should slow down Draconis' damage rate against large stacks of neutral creeps with a lower level of Fiery Barrage for his level 1-4 jungling from autoattacks, while simultaneously ensuring that 1 Dragonflame cast does not nearly wipe out an entire camp. Overall, jungling should be better for the average player early on, while the damage output against stacks should be slower when Draconis is level 3-6.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Drunken Master</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Stagger</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Using Lunge now resets the cooldown of Stagger (instead of reducing its cooldown to 0.8 seconds).
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Drink</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now instantly grants 3/6/9/12 Drink charges upon starting the channel.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>3 Point Strike</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Strike point reset delay increased from 8 seconds to 12 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Just a few more quality-of-life changes to Drunken Master to improve his combat flow in accordance with his Drink usage.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Empath</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Essence Link</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Tether break range increased from 100 to 200.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> State on Empath (or the target ally hero, if used while As One is active) is no longer considered a buff (and thus can no longer be dispelled).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This ensures that Essence Link does not get dispelled if As One is used after Essence Link is cast.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Note that the debuff on the enemy can still be dispelled, which will cancel Essence Link on Empath (or her host from As One).
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Engineer</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>The Keg</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage increased from 90/150/210/270 to 90/160/230/300.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Stun duration increased from 1.6/1.8/2/2.2 seconds to 1.6/1.9/2.2/2.5 seconds.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Fayde</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Shadow Walk</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now properly acts as a disjoint upon activation.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Flint Beastwood</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Hollowpoint Shells</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Physical Damage reduced from 20/40/60/80 to 16/34/52/70.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Stun duration reduced from 0.05/0.1/0.15/0.2 seconds to 0/0.05/0.1/0.15 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now only procs against enemy units (i.e. no longer procs against wards or ally units).
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Money Shot</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown changed from 20/15/10 seconds to 20 seconds.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Goldenveil</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Dagger Dance</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now deals 3.5/5/6.5/8 Magic Damage every 0.25 seconds to targets other than the main target within the area of effect.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Perch & Plunge</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> While Perching on a tree, cooldown is set to 6 seconds if the Perched tree is destroyed.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Ichor</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Life Leech</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Life Leech's state application now occurs before the Magic Damage takes place.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This allows the Magic Damage dealt by this ability to trigger from the Life Leech state, allowing Ichor to gain a small amount of healing when Life Leech's projectile hits an enemy.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Keeper of the Forest</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Nature's Guidance</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Stealth state on Keeper of the Forest will not be dispelled if Nature's Guidance is cast while near trees.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Klanx</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>B.A.N.G.</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> State duration for enemies facing the flash increased from 1.5 seconds to 2 seconds.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Lackey</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Shots now deal 0.33x damage in a 300 radius to enemies around (but excluding) the main target.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Kraken</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Release the Kraken!</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now constantly applies Restrain to enemies within radius.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Ophelia</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Nature's Wrath</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cast Range increased from 600 to 700.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Command</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Movement Speed bonus for creeps reduced from 10/20/30/40 to 15/20/25/30.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Max Health bonus reduced from 40/120/160/200 to 0/60/90/120.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Creeps controlled with Command now have a minimum Base Health of 600/700/800/900.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Combined with the neutral creep changes in this patch, these changes should slightly reduce Ophelia's performance later in the game without destroying the hero's performance and unique tempo control during the early game.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes also allow Ophelia to have some other targets for Command as the game progresses without sacrificing much durability on them.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Pandamonium</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Flurry</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now destroys trees within its affected area.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Flick</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now deals 20 Physical Damage to the target upon landing near them.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Delay for flicking (after landing near the target) reduced from 0.4 seconds to 0.35 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Pandamonium is no longer stunned for a full 0.5 seconds before actually flicking the target backwards.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Instead, the stun duration on Pandamonium for his Flick animation now matches the delay time for flicking (0.35 seconds).
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Face Smash</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Pandamonium now faces the target after every attack.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This ensures that Pandamonium faces the target consistently, if for some reason the target or Pandamonium are displaced without breaking the channel.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Some simple quality-of-life changes were made to Pandamonium, making him feel more responsive for the player playing the hero.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Pandamonium's Flurry now has more consistent behaviour while near a tree line, and he can act a little sooner out of the Flick animation.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The small damage addition to Flick makes it a more reliable tool to put an enemy's Portal Key on cooldown and dispel an enemy's Health Potion, etc.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Parasite</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Infest</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Experience and Gold granted to Parasite when the Infested Creep dies is now a static 125 Experience and 75 Gold (rather than the values based off of the Infested Creep).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This will always happen regardless of how the Infested Creep dies.

<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This is a small buff, as the tapering mechanic starts later in the slow duration.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Shadowblade has been liked mostly as a carry that can choose and change their main attribute/build throughout the game, rather than a jack-of-all-trades hero.

<br />Changes to Armor Items:
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Ring of the Teacher</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Armor bonus for self increased from 1 to 2.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Armor bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 2 to 1.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mana Regeneration bonus from the aura increased from 0.65 to 0.8.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Abyssal Skull</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now passively grants 2 Armor to self.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Armor bonus to allies from the aura reduced from 5 to 3.5.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mana Regeneration bonus from the aura increased from 0.8 to 1.0.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Nome's Wisdom</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now passively grants 2 Armor to self.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Movement Speed bonus reduced from 65 to 55.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Sol's Bulwark</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Armor bonus to allies from the ally aura reduced from 3 to 2.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Armor items have had far too much benefit for allies at such a low cost.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The aura effects of these items were generally made weaker so that Physical Damage is not countered so easily and quickly for an entire team in the early phases of the game.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br />Changes to the Mana Battery line of items:
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Mana Battery</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Added back into the game (exact same item as Power Supply from Patch 4.9.1, just with a different name, icon and visual effects).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Cost: 200 Gold
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Available to be purchased in the Relics shop and Outpost.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Power Supply</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now upgrades from Mana Battery.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Components: Mana Battery (200 Gold) + Minor Totem (50 Gold) + Minor Totem (50 Gold) + Recipe (240 Gold) = 540 Gold Total
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passively grants 3 Strength, Agility and Intelligence.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Maximum of 15 charges.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer purchasable in the Outpost.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The other effects are the same as Mana Battery.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Sacrificial Stone</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe cost increased from 110 Gold to 420 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total cost increased from 850 Gold to 1500 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base bonus Strength, Agility and Intelligence increased from 5 to 8.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Increased Healing Done adjusted from +15% to +20%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Mana Battery and Power Supply both fulfilled unique benefits and had solid reasons to be picked up early in the game at their specific price points, so they were both largely reverted back to their legacy states.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Sacrificial Stone would be too stat-efficient if its recipe cost was not adjusted, though we still want the item to have a solid reason to be picked up. Therefore, it is now one of the most stat-efficient items to pick up and upgrades from a fantastic item at a moderate (but relatively affordable) cost. It also buffs healing output even more as its particular niche effect.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Frostwolf's Skull</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Movement Speed Slow (when used by a melee hero) increased from 35% to 40%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Scouting activation: radius increased from 5000 units to 7000 units.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Scouting activation: cooldown reduced from 30 seconds to 24 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Dire Frost Wolf activation: cooldown reduced from 50 seconds to 40 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Dire Frost Wolf activation: in addition to its current effects, also applies a 1 second Root on impact.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Ghost Marchers</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passive Movement Speed bonus reduced from 70 to 60.

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Grimoire of Power</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe cost reduced from 1100 Gold to 900 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total cost reduced from 5400 Gold to 5200 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Active effect has been reworked:
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Activate to grant+30% Spell Damage to self for 15 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The defensive effect on Grimoire of Power was too strong for the game. It is likely to make a return with more appropriate negative side effects on another item in the future.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> In the meantime, Grimoire of Power's effect is reminiscent of its previous passive effect.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Orb of Zamos & Grave Locket</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus gold multiplier increased from 0.25x to 0.75x when a non-player controlled Neutral Creep is killed by the corresponding Synchronized hero.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Ultor's Heavy Helm</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Component change: instead of Ringmail, now requires a Shield of the Five.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe cost reduced from 1025 Gold to 675 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total cost remains the same (3650 Gold).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now passively grants 2 bonus Strength, Agility and Intelligence.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Active effect now also grants 1 Armor to affected allies.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Bonus Armor effect does not stack with Plated Greaves or Shield of the Five.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Damage Block value for self increased from 70 to 80 (35 to 40 if you are a ranged hero that has Ultor's Heavy Helm).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Shield of the Five now builds into an item other than Plated Greaves, making Ultor's Heavy Helm more viable (especially with the nerfs to the other team Armor items).</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Credits to datfizh for the general suggestions for Ultor's Heavy Helm!</em></span><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Void Talisman</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe cost reduced from 1160 Gold to 1060 Gold.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Ember Shard state on enemies now expire when Adrenaline is dead.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> However, if they are already getting pulled when Adrenaline actually dies, the pull will still continue as intended.

<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This has no gameplay impact in most situations and makes the behaviour consistent with other projectile-based travel behaviour from other abilities.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Nomad</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> True Strike now applies a lingering sighted/revealed state on the target for 1 second or until True Strike's attack occurs (whichever occurs first), after its trigger conditions are met (i.e. when entering into melee range of the target).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> True Strike's trigger range reduced from 200 to 175.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> All of these small adjustments to True Strike/Mirage Strike mitigate the instances where the skill is being abnormally cancelled in certain conditions (e.g. near trees when the opponent is attempting to fog you).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> In the majority of circumstances, this will not affect gameplay and only serve as quality-of-life changes.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Pebbles</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Chuck now properly deals damage to the thrown unit when the thrown unit is unbound from the projectile.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Pestilence</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Fixed an exploit where Swarm (when boosted by Staff of the Master) can globally affect an enemy unit.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Prisoner</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The ball and chain from Shackled will now properly follow a unit if that unit becomes order disjointed (e.g. with Fayde's Shadow Walk ability).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Prison Break's effects (when boosted by Staff of the Master) now properly affects Physically Immune units if targeting self.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Prison Break's effects (when boosted by Staff of the Master) no longer become dispelled if an affected target gains invulnerability at any point before the state naturally expires.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Rampage</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Might of the Herd no longer interrupts your order queue when activated.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Tooltip for Horned Strike no longer mistakenly says that it has Bash properties.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Rhapsody</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> In-game icon now displays the default avatar icon (rather than the HD avatar icon).
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Riptide</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Undertow's tooltip now properly states it deals 30/45/60/75 Magic Damage.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> No gameplay change has been made, as Undertow still deals this damage even prior to this patch.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Shadowblade</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Soul's Sight's effects that apply on the first hit will now properly check for misses (e.g. against Void Talisman or Evasion sources) and immunities (e.g. Shrunken Head) when the attack projectile impacts, rather than predetermining the effect when the attack projectile is launched.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Fixed some incorrect model positions for Shadowblade's avatars in the HoN store.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Solstice</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Illuminate no longer interrupts your order queue when activated.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Tempest</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Elementals do not inherit their forced-attack order after splitting if they were affected by Deadlift's Onslaught state.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Vindicator</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Space Wizard Merlin's Glyph of Silence now properly plays its catchy space jam soundtrack while it is active!
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Wildsoul</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Throwback Wildsoul now shows the correct model in the HoN store and avatar selection screen.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Witch Slayer</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Attack projectiles for Pimp Slayer and Witch Hunter now have the correct models.
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Items </span>=
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Bottle, Health Potion, Mana Potion, Rejuvenation Potion, Refreshment Rune effects</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Damage from sources that are non-boss, non-player controlled (NPC) neutral creeps (when not owned by a player) will no longer accidentally disable the active states of these items if the source deals damage to the hero while the source is dead (e.g. a ranged projectile that hits a hero after the source dies).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Refreshment Rune's state is now consistent with the behaviour of the related state effects from Bottle, Health Potion, Mana Potion and Rejuvenation Potion.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Genjuro</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Each player can only purchase a maximum of 1 Genjuro per game.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Genjuro can no longer be dropped.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Homecoming Stone</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Disarm state on towers is no longer considered a Debuff.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This should prevent assist attribution bugs if a tower kills a hero while someone is teleporting to it.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Veiled Rot</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Effect now also applies in a 600 radius around the user for the user's owned units when the fade state expires naturally.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This does not change much in most situations, but it specifically lets Parasite properly take advantage of Veiled Rot with his Infested creep (i.e. use Veiled Rot, then Infest a creep).
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Whispering Helm</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Can no longer be activated on a Mimic (e.g. Moira's Ephemeral Forge, Circe's Twisted Visage).
