<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Hero Rework - Adrenaline </span>=
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Adrenaline has been reworked to have a completely new niche, specializing in catching heroes with high mobility.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Death's Halo is the crux of the rework, essentially being changed to act as an "Arena" skill. This skill forces all units to essentially be confined within a space for a duration, essentially locking down a teamfight to take place in an area.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> As a result, Adrenaline also acts as a true counter to heroes with escape abilities (or the recipient of mobility sources like Rally's Compel or Tablet of Command) by forcing them to stay within Death's Halo.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Adrenaline also has a new playstyle that favours engaging multiple heroes at once, while aiming to catch and trap as many heroes as possible to prevent their escape & give his team an advantage.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> In the process, Adrenaline lost his key frustration factors when his opponents were playing against him. These frustration factors include (but are not limited to): True Damage % based on Max Health with no actual counterplay, having too much uptime on his lane harass, and having way too many dashes available at once, gated only by Mana Cost rather than Mana Cost and cooldown.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Because of all these changes, Adrenaline's "energy" mechanic has been removed from the game. It allowed Adrenaline to have infinite harass in the laning phase & his skills had to be much weaker to compensate for that, and was overall too difficult to properly balance for the scope of the entire game. The "energy" mechanic just does not have a place in HoN where Health Sustain sources are costly to obtain in the laning phase.</em></span><br /><br />

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Blacksmith is receiving numerous buffs (mentioned later in the patch notes), so the boosted Chaotic Flames ability (Risky Cast) had to be severely limited in its usage, as it was used as a "free" second proc of Fireball most of the time with generally unlimited availability.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Risky Cast is truly an ultimate-like ability that is worthy of a cooldown appropriate for an ultimate ability.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Fear not - Blacksmith's other buffs in this patch will more than make up for this nerf!</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes should reduce the advantages of the team that has the first hero pick and gives the team that goes second some opportunity to counter pick in the drafting phase of the game.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Overall, these changes allow for increased hero pick diversity in competitive tournaments!</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> General </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Towers: Bonus Attack Damage dealt to heroes changed from 20 to 20 + (1 per game minute elapsed).

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer grants True Strike to allies.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This change should help Arachna be a slightly better lane bully, without bringing back all of the frustration factors associated with the hero.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Precision's aura effect also overloaded the ability with utility.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Movement Speed Slow applied by abilities changed from 15% to 13/16/19/22%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Artillery's premise for being a long range hero has been one of the main causes of the frustration in playing against the hero.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Artillery was buffed in certain areas, while simultaneously reducing his max spell Cast Range values slightly until there is more time to properly address his hero design more thoroughly.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The Magic Damage on Spider Mines has been reduced when used as an on-demand nuke so that the ability is less of a stellar reliable ranged nuke compared to other support heroes.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Engineer had way more damage than other support heroes prior to these changes (he is secretly a hero with 3 nukes), so these changes put him on a more even power level relative to other support heroes, while frontloading more of the Magic Damage on The Keg (a skillshot) instead.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The overall changes here should let Engineer have a smoother distribution of Magic Damage between his abilities & over time, rather than having him get all the meaningful Magic Damage in a reliable manner only through Spider Mines.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> With the changes to the max number of Spider Mines placed at once, there is no need for a stack limit mechanic any longer. By the time Engineer maxes out Spider Mines, there is a small time window where 5 Spider Mines can 1-shot an enemy hero, but this still needs considerable setup time & takes away from potential scouting uses for said time period. Once this short time period passes by, Engineer should use Spider Mines as a scouting tool and an on-demand nuke when it comes down to practical usage.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The changes to the detonate mechanic removes a great discrepancy between lower & mid skill level brackets vs. high skill brackets in terms of hero performance statistics, so it should be much easier to appropriately balance Engineer for all skill brackets from this time onward.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Overall, Engineer is now more in line with the damage progression of a ganker/nuker, while having support-like utility once he gets access to Energy Field and higher levels of Steam Turret.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes make Puppet Master just a tad less burst-oriented, while increasing his overall damage output over time and improving the availability of his spells.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The increased damage change should amplify Qi's niche against strong autoattacking heroes without affecting his performance too much against heroes that have less items.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The extra ease of repositioning the Spirit Shredder around will make Qi more flexible in Spirit Shredder usage and placement as well.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> If Rampage and the dragged target gets separated by more than 600 units, the chains are broken.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Rampage's Greater Rhino lacked uniqueness and function when compared to other heroes.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> By giving Rampage one of his iconic abilities back, he can once again controllably reposition a foe against their will.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now also grants 15/20/25/30% increased Healing Output while affected by Arcane Hymn.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Elaboration of mechanics: for Rhapsody, since Arcane Hymn applies to Rhapsody all the time, Disco Inferno will heal for an increased amount from Arcane Hymn.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Another example: Jeraziah is affected by Arcane Hymn, and he casts Inner Light to heal an ally that is not affected by Arcane Hymn. Inner Light still gets its healing amplified, since the source of healing (Jeraziah) is affected by Arcane Hymn.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> An example where the healing output increase does not apply: Jeraziah is not affected by Arcane Hymn, and casts Inner Light on another hero that is affected by Arcane Hymn. Inner Light will not have its healing amplified, since the source of healing (Jeraziah) is not affected by Arcane Hymn.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Rhapsody has been falling behind in the meta as other supports proved to be more versatile and reliable than her, so her abilities have been adjusted to compensate for that.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Disco Inferno has a new option that properly rewards movement with Rhapsody & heroes in general, should the player choose to use that option.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Note that Arcane Hymn's aura radius will no longer match Protective Melody's radius.

<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Feint's Siphon</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now only steals Attack Damage when used against enemy player-controlled units.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Shadowblade had many frustration factors, and most of them stem from the long defensive bonuses from Gargantuan Form throughout the entire duration.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Buffing the Armor & Magic Armor bonus substantially while reducing the duration means that the player only gains the mass Armor/Magic Armor bonuses for a brief duration when using Gargantuan's Blast to damage & slow enemies.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Feint's Siphon no longer steals Attack Damage to avoid him speedfarming neutrals when he obtains a Runed Cleaver.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Ideally, Shadowblade should be a more true jack-of-all-trades hero, so his base stats have been substantially increased to bolster his early game performance, at the cost of his scaling (and thus, his carry capability) in the mid/late game.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Shadowblade should now perform much better as a semi-carry jack-of-all-trades hero, even in the laning phase (where his starting Attack Damage has been considerably increased, particularly in Soul's Sight form).

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Has the same properties as Post Haste, with the following changes:
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Allows the user to also teleport to real ally heroes.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Teleport target will not be disabled while the channel effect is happening.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> The teleport effect still cancels if the target hero dies before the channel ends.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Base Movement Speed increased from 105 to 125.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This item is meant to be a luxury upgrade from Post Haste, allowing a hero to teleport to another ally hero for global ganks and pushes without relying on the presence of a creep wave or ally creep.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Armor of the Mad Mage (Reworked)</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> New buildup: Luminous Prism (1500) + Helm of the Victim (900) + Recipe (800) = 3200 Gold Total
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passive bonuses: 8 Armor, 5 Health Regeneration per second, 18 Intelligence

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Nome's Wisdom was granting a little too much value for its price point and enabled deathball compositions a little too much.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Farming items that actually have an upgrade should be expensive, as farming items are normally obtained for the purposes of farming & not to substantially increase your actual hero combat ability.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Furthermore, the active ability was used to accelerate farm in a split pushing manner, and was just doing too much.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Active state now also applies a 30% Attack Speed Slow (stacking additively with the aura's Attack Speed Slow).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Frostfield Plate is now much more focused on a heavy Attack Speed Slow on its active ability, at the cost of having less effective passive bonuses and a weaker Movement Speed Slow on the active state.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> As a result, Frostfield Plate's usage and purpose is now even more differentiated from Frostwolf's Skull.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Lightbrand Item Line Changes</span></strong>
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Lightbrand, Frozen Light, Searing Light, Dawnbringer, Grimoire of Power</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Searing effect is now also applied by non-Returned, non-DoT Damage.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Lightbrand</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now also grants 6% non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal (2% against non-hero units).
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Frozen Light and Searing Light</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now also grants 10% non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal (3% against non-hero units).
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Dawnbringer</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now also grants 15% non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal (5% against non-hero units).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Searing effect's Magic Damage per second per charge increased from 16 to 18.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Grimoire of Power</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe Cost reduced from 800 Gold to 700 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total Cost reduced from 5100 Gold to 5000 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage Lifesteal no longer applies on Magic DoT effects.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal increased from 15% to 20% (7% against non-hero units).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Ravenor no longer receives a penalty for this item's non-DoT Magic Damage Lifesteal.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Active effect completely reworked:
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Activate to instantly dispel Debuffs and Stuns on self, and grant 100% Debuff and Stun Duration reduction for the next 1 second. Note that this will not protect you from continuous area effects (such as Chronos' Chronofield) or blue-bordered states like Succubus' Hold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Grimoire of Power can be activated even while Stunned or Perplexed.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Cooldown: 70 seconds
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Mana Cost: 100
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Grimore of Power's previous active effect (increased Magic Lifesteal) was too specific to heroes & it was hard to take advantage of that mechanic if you enter a battle at close to full HP & you need to use your important spells as soon as possible.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The item's active effect has been completely reworked to be more suitable for heroes that want to ensure their important spells/item usage go off even if they are caught by surprise (so long as they are not bursted down before having a chance to react).</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This new effect is powerful enough such that it is generally usable on all heroes, but will benefit heroes with key abilities & items more often. The duration is short enough such that there is counterplay.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Finally, the Lightbrand item line now only works on non-DoT Magic Damage sources. This is due to some effects (like Mock of Brilliance) synergizing too well with a cheap item like Lightbrand.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This change was partially done to address the issues with vision regarding the bottom rune.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Damage mechanic against illusions changed from Direct Health Removal to True Damage.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This should not make a difference in most circumstances & primarily only makes a difference against Xemplar's Schism illusions.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Barbed Armor</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Returned Damage is now based on pre-mitigation damage (rather than post-mitigation damage).
