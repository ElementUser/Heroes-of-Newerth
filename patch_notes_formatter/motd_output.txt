<br /><br /><br />==<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ffa500;"> Forests of Caldavar ("New") </span></strong>==
<br />The main goal of the changes to the "new" Forests of Caldavar map is to make the viability of each laning setup choice to be more on par with one another, while retaining their own unique benefits and disadvantages.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Legion bottom lane and Hellbourne top lane trees were rearranged significantly.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Legion's southeastern most pull camp: a tree to the left of the camp (and to the right of the Observatory) has been removed to allow heroes to move through the nearby path.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> There were far too many spots near the lane that made it nearly impossible to find a hero unless you were right next to the hero (and even then, sometimes it was nearly impossible to do so)., which led to unhealthy play patterns by solo unsafe lane heroes.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes address that issue, while still allowing for some niche hiding spots to be discovered. While this may appear to be a nerf to solo unsafe lane heroes, the jungle changes will more than compensate for that.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Jungle Changes </span>=
<br />Hellbourne bottom lane - Medium pull camp (unsafe lane)
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Camp is now more accessible to the unsafe lane to be pulled into the lane
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Trees in this area now allow for better vision from the unsafe lane, while the vision of that camp ends up being more obscured for the safe lane
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Also reworked tree patch in this area to more closely mirror the Hellbourne side of the map.
<br />Legion Ancients camp
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now spawns a Hard neutral camp instead of an Ancients neutral camp.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The other central Hard neutral camp has been replaced with a Medium neutral camp.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> A few trees have been removed to allow for more visibility & to allow for a slightly easier double stack.
<br />Legion left-most Medium & Hard neutral camps
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Camps were shifted slightly towards the bottom-right.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Leash range of these camps have been reverted to normal.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Path between both camps are now more cleared of obstructions.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Distance between both camps are now more similar to the Hellbourne equivalent (top-right-most) camps.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> These changes prevent the camps from being pulled towards the Legion middle lane, while simultaneously solving the difficulties of being difficult to double-stack these camps (due to a prior temporary fix).
<br />Legion top lane - Medium pull camp (unsafe lane)
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Camp is now more accessible to the unsafe lane to be pulled into the lane.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Trees in this area now allow for better vision from the unsafe lane, while the vision of that camp ends up being more obscured for the safe lane.
<br />Hellbourne Ancients camp
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now spawns a Hard neutral camp instead of an Ancients neutral camp.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The other central Hard neutral camp has been replaced with a Medium neutral camp.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This camp has also been rotated to face the new Hard camp more directly.
<br />Hellbourne top-right-most Hard camp
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> This neutral camp was shifted slightly downward.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Leash range of the camp has been reverted to normal.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> This prevents the camps from being pulled towards the Hellbourne top lane.
<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Most of these jungle changes were done to balance the jungles between the Legion side and Hellbourne side, as well as make the top and bottom lanes slightly more equal in terms of the safe and unsafe lanes.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Overall, these changes (coupled with other changes in previous patches like the Merrick's Rune change) should make laning setup choices more balanced with regards to one another (any permutation/combination of 2-1-2 vs. 1-1-2-jungle and other dynamic variants involving partial/full roamers).</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Neutral Creep Changes </span>=

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Predasaur Crusher</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Gold Bounty: 58-66 -> 70-85
<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The previous Gold Bounty nerfs have been reverted because there will now only be 1 Ancient Camp in the "new" Forests of Caldavar map.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Some stat adjustments were also made to make the camps more comparable to one another in terms of power, while still retaining their unique strengths and weaknesses.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Mid Wars Changes </span>=
<br />The main goal of these changes to Mid Wars is to resolve some common frustrations encountered by players in this mode, while slowly leaning towards rewarding properly applied early/mid game aggressive plays & pushes.
<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Zorgath and Transmutanstein return to Mid Wars!
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Say goodbye to Snotter Boss until next time!
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Matchmaking constraints for Mid Wars are slightly less relaxed, which should result in increasing the chances of getting a more enjoyable match.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Earliest concede time availability reduced from 10 minutes to 5 minutes.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This vote still requires 5 votes from a single team to actually pass (at least until 15 minutes where the usual reduction in required votes occurs).
<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Backdoor Protection is now applied to the Melee and Ranged Barracks as well, and grants the Barracks 50% Damage Reduction against non-hero units while active (Main Base structure has 50% Damage Reduction against non-hero units by default already).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Additionally, the Backdoor Protection state on the Main Base Structure and Barracks now also grants 50% Damage Reduction against heroes.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This change should help slow down uncoordinated & uncommitted attempts to end the game by backdooring to the point where the defending team can react and take action before the Main Base Structure falls.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The intention is not to remove backdooring (as it has its place to end the game when there are long stalemates for long periods of time), but to make it more of a committal and coordinated strategy to execute & introduce more opportunities to counterplay it. We understand that games ended abruptly without much means for counterplay makes for an anti-climatic ending, but having backdooring as an alternate game-ending option for long games is still necessary if the circumstances make it viable.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Main Base Structure's Health Regeneration per second reduced from 50 to 20 (when not damaged by an enemy within the last 10 seconds).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This change partially addresses the frustration of getting the base to a low Health value, only to see it regenerate to full Health too quickly.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Neutral camp composition has been changed (no longer spawns traditional the Hard neutral camps).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Instead, now spawns 1 of the following camps:
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Dragon Master, Skeleton King, Vagabond Leader, Ice Ogre
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Predasaur Crusher, Vulture Lord, Minotaur, Wolf Commander
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Dreadbeetle Queen, Catman Champion, Vulture Lord, Wild Hunter
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This change provides minimal disruption to the current map, while making the Gold & Experience value of the neutral camp more suitable for the mid & late game (rather than something that can be tackled in the early game by 1-2 heroes) and simultaneously discourages raw jungling early on (to keep the spirit of the map's name - Mid Wars).</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Furthermore, this change allows Ophelia and Parasite to make use of Ancient Creeps if they have Staff of the Master.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This also allows these heroes more variety of creeps they can take control of in the early game, though the Ancient creep has to be cleared (or the camp needs to be stacked) for them to spawn more neutral creeps they can take control of in the early game.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Respawn time equation has been changed.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Old equation: Respawn Time (s) = 0.6 * Hero_Level
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> New equation: Respawn Time (s) = (0.5 * Hero_Level) + 3.75 * (2 - Ally_Nonbase_Towers_Remaining)
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The new respawn times allow for slightly faster early game respawns, while extending the respawn times by 3.75 seconds for each of your ally non-base towers that have been destroyed.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This gives pushing some tangible benefit in Mid Wars and disfavours turtling, without making early/mid game strategies too snowbally in nature.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Overall, this increases the respawn time at level 25 from 17 seconds (in all situations) to 12.5/16.25/20 seconds when 0/1/2 of your non-base towers are down. Further adjustments may be made in the future if this does not prove to be enough of a change.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><br />==<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ffa500;"> Design </span></strong>==
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Max Disconnection Time reduced from 5 minutes to 4 minutes.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> AFK Timer duration reduced from 4 minutes to 2.5 minutes.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> AFK Warning time reduced from 3 minutes to 1.5 minutes.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> While we understand that real-life situations & technical difficulties can happen once in a blue moon, they should not be happening frequently in any capacity.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Players should be active in the game for as much time as possible without disrupting the gameplay for others, and these changes help encourage players to make sure that they exhibit due diligence on their part to do so.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br />Fortification of Sol / Demonic Fortification
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now goes on a 90 second cooldown when the game starts.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Prevents players from accidentally triggering it at the start of the game while typing & transitioning from the hero pick lobby to the in-game map.
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes </span>=

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Staff of the Master effect change (to pre-existing):
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> The initial application of Demonic Pathogen (through this ability) now only affects enemy heroes (instead of enemy heroes and creeps).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Demonic Pathogen (when applied through this ability) state duration reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5 seconds.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now Reveals affected targets.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Note that this does not grant innate Sight of the target, but simply means that affected targets are detected as though they are not Stealthed.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Doctor Repulsor</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Starting Attack Damage changed from 47-57 to 50-54.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Attack action time reduced from 500ms to 350ms.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Magnetic Contraption</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown increased from 4 seconds to 10/8/6/4 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cast backswing reduced from 400ms to 300ms.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Opposite Charges</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mana Cost reduced from 100 to 70/80/90/100.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Duration reduced from 1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds to 1/1.4/1.8/2.2 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer applies a Movement Speed Slow to self upon use.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Electric Frenzy</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now also resets your autoattack cooldown upon using an ability.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage increased from 30/50/70/90 to 40/60/80/100.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now grants +50 Attack Speed for the boosted attack (helps make this one attack launch faster).
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Ludicrous Speed</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer resets your autoattack cooldown upon use (since Electric Frenzy does that now).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer Stunned while travelling.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Instead, Doctor Repulsor is Perplexed (unable to use items) while travelling.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This means that Doctor Repulsor can autoattack & cast spells while Ludicrous Speed is active!
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> The Perplexed state remains on Doctor Repulsor for 0.8 seconds after exiting Ludicrous Speed.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage dealt per 100 units travelled reduced from 15/20/25 to 6/12/18.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Max Magic Damage dealt per instance reduced from 300/400/500 to 200/300/400.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown increased from 0.3 seconds to 0.4 seconds.
<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Doctor Repulsor has an odd power curve due to the nature of Ludicrous Speed. His laning presence has been virtually non-existent because of his long range ganking potential at level 6, so some raw damage was taken away from Ludicrous Speed, while giving him much better tools for laning & the early game in general.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes do weaken the raw damage output through his ultimate alone, but the autoattack reset mechanic on Electric Frenzy opens up new combo routes & makes micromanaging his mana pool for Ludicrous Speed even more important. Player mechanical skill in terms of mouse speed & accuracy, cancelling the cast backswing of his abilities, as well as taking advantage of some returning mechanics on Ludicrous Speed will optimize the effectiveness of Doctor Repulsor, while simultaneously retaining options for counterplay (e.g. the Perplex state on Doctor Repulsor means item usage is not immediately available to him after exiting Ludicrous Speed).</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Overall, these changes favour Doctor Repulsor more in terms of getting that long range ganking power spike at level 6 (which is his unique strength compared to every other hero), without frontloading the power on Ludicrous Speed itself. The changes make him less effective when played as a raw carry if relying on the damage from Ludicrous Speed, and more of a core hero that focuses on capitalizing on the uniqueness of his ganker-carry role and playstyle.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
