<p><strong><span style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 18pt;">Welcome to Heroes of Newerth</span></strong></span><br /><strong><span style="color: #ffd700; font-size: 18pt;">Version 4.9.1 - 2 February 2021</span></strong></p>
<br /><br /><br />==<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ffa500;"> New Content </span></strong>==
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>New Loading Screens have been rotated into the game!</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The new loading screen art will represent and celebrate the Lunar New Year!
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This means that the fan art backgrounds (from Patch 4.9.0) will be rotated out of the game. We apologize for the inconvenience.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> We are delighted to have those art pieces in our game, but we regret to inform that a substantial portion of the player base are unhappy with the art. It is unlikely they will return to the game - if they do return, it will be on a background art rotation basis.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>New Behemoth Avatar: Exo Behe</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Get ready to electrify your competition with this new Behemoth avatar!

<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Chance to cast Fireball, Flaming Hammer or Frenzy when autoattacking increased from 10% to 15%.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Credits to Whyzozerious for the visual effect changes for Staff of the Master effect visuals!</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Cosmetic Updates </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> HUD has been reverted to its state prior to Patch 4.9.0.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Music tracks have been reverted to their state prior to Patch 4.9.0.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Christmas is over, thus the Forests of Caldavar ("New") and Mid Wars maps have reverted to its state prior to Patch 4.9.0.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> After some reconsideration, keeping the UI in from February to April is not suitable.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The priority level of name colours (in which they display in a chat channel) have been readjusted to be more suitable in terms of their overall value.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> The most notable change is the Gold Shield color - players who use this name colour appear above all other non-volunteer, non-staff name colours (for their help to get HoN started)!
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> User Interface </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Region selection checkboxes are now visible in the "Play Now" screen (for the "new UI"), without having to press the "Regions" button.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This change should improve visibility on what regions a user is queuing for before actually queuing up for a game.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Region selection for all players will be reset when the patch occurs.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> By default,  no regions will be selected (as opposed to having all of them selected).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This change will force players to select the regions they prefer, and should drastically alleviate issues with players playing on servers where they have high ping.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Forests of Caldavar ("New") </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff0066";>Kongor Buff Reward</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Movement Speed reward: bonus Movement Speed per charge reduced from 15 to 12.
<br />Neutral Camps
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Slightly reduced the creep max travel distance of the left-most Legion easy camp.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Werebeast Enchanter</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Far Sight's Clearvision radius reduced from 1800 to 1200.
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Ranked Pick </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Banning Phase duration increased from 20 seconds to 30 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Wait time between end of banning phase and start of picking phase reduced from 5 seconds to 3 seconds.
<br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Matchmaking </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Player colour order is now fully randomized in Matchmaking and Champions of Newerth games.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> In other words, the player with the highest MMR in Matchmaking and Champions of Newerth games will no longer always be in the Blue or Pink player slot.
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> General </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Ranged Creep aggro range reduced from 800 to 750.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This change slightly buffs solo suicide/off-lane heroes.
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Heroes </span>=
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Adrenaline</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Primary attribute changed from Agility to Strength.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Armor increased from 2.36 to 3.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Strength increased from 20 to 24.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Strength growth per level increased from 2 to 2.5.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Agility reduced from 24 to 18.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Agility growth per level reduced from 2.4 to 1.6.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Intelligence increased from 18 to 20.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.5 to 1.8.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Shard Blast</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus damage is now based on Strength (instead of Agility).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mana Cost reduced from 80/90/100/110 to 55/70/85/100.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Magic Damage increased from 80/115/150/185 to 80/120/160/200.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Magic Damage based on your primary attribute increased from 20/30/40/50% to 30/40/50/60%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Touch radius increased from 90 to 100 (120 on tooltip for cast indicator accuracy).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown is now reduced to 0.5 seconds (from 0.6 seconds) when hitting 2 or more enemy heroes with this ability.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Rush</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now behaves like a regular dash/charge with pathing (i.e. does not force the destination to be at the very end, like Dark Lady's Charging Strikes).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> No longer cuts trees along its path.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown reduced from 14/13/12/11 seconds to 13/12/11/10 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Range rescaled from 700 to 575/650/725/800.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer has a Dread Stack mechanic.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage changed from 20 + (10 Magic Damage per Dread Stack consumed) to 80/120/160/200 + 30/40/50/60% of your Strength.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Ember Shard</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Tether duration changed from 1.8/2.2/2.6/3 seconds to 2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Self state duration increased from 4 seconds to 8 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now refreshes attack cooldown on cast.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Enemies now also receive a 25% Movement Speed Slow (in addition to being Restrained) after being pulled.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Restrain/Movement Speed Slow state duration changed from 1 second to 0.8/1.2/1.6/2 seconds.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Death's Halo</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Duration is reduced by 1 second when Adrenaline receives cumulative damage equal to 25% of his Max Health (from 20%).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer grants an Agility bonus per real hero trapped.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now grants 4/6/8 bonus Strength, 2 bonus Attack Damage, and 1 bonus Armor per real hero trapped (x2 for enemy heroes).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Armor bonus per real hero caught increased from 1 to 1.5.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Adrenaline was dependent on too many attributes, and many options could have been taken to address this. Changing from an Agility hero to a Strength hero was the option that was chosen. With the proper readjustments, he now only requires damage and mana sustain to be effective.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Adrenaline was also still not surviving nearly as much as expected against multiple opponents during Death's Halo, so he received significant durability buffs while it is active.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Armadon</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Armordillo</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Spine Burst damage threshold when taking damage to the rear reduced from 150 Damage to 130 Damage.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Artillery</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>LRM</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now deals 0.8x Damage to non-hero units.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Artillery's weakness of farming was alleviated a little too well. A slight reduction to damage dealt against non-hero units should balance his performance out once again.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Calamity</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Dragon's Path</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage per dragon reduced from 25/50/70/95 to 20/45/65/90.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Funeral Pyre</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Agility gain state on self duration reduced from 1.75x to 1.25x the original state duration.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Damage dealt by the extra attack instance now deals 50/60/70/80% of Calamity's Attack Damage (instead of 100%).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Calamity has seen a recent increase in play rate with great success, particularly in tournament play.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Most of her damage is coming from Funeral Pyre and Dragon's Path, so small nerfs to these abilities should make it more bearable to deal with her in the laning phase and during mid-game.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Defiler</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Unholy Expulsion</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Spirit Movement Speed and Max Movement Speed increased from 400/450/500 to 650.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Draconis</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Movement Speed reduced from 300 to 290.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Draconic Defense</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown increased from 60/55/50/45 seconds to 75/70/65/60 seconds.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Fiery Barrage</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Physical Damage per second changed from 6/12/18/24 to 5/10/15/20.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes should mitigate Draconis' farming speed in the jungle early on and give him a little bit more of a weakness overall.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Drunken Master</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Agility increased from 12 to 14.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Drink</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Max Charges increased from 16/24/32/40 to 18/27/36/45.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total max Evasion and Stun/Debuff Duration Reduction increased from 16/24/32/40% to 18/27/36/45%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> In addition to existing bonuses, each Drink charge now also grants a 1.5% Chance to Critically Strike for 1.5x Attack Damage.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Healing from the natural expiration of a Drunk Charge increased from 6 Health to 7 Health.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>3 Point Strike</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Physical Damage reduced from 300/475/600 to 250/375/500.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Drunken Master has historically been too focused on being bursty and being built as a glass cannon.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> With the iterations of Drunken Master in 2018-2020, the major complaint was that 3 Point Strike required little to no skill to deal an immaculate amount of burst damage to his targets during the early to mid game.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Recent changes have addressed this by making it take a bit more skill to achieve said burst and bring back the healthy mechanics of the original Drink ability, though the hero has been underperforming.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> To address all of these concerns and address the hero's performance, a decent amount of damage has been shifted from his ultimate and placed into his Drink mechanic.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Maintaining a high number of Drink charges allow him to function as a traditional carry/semi-carry, granting him a multitude of defensive and offensive buffs, while still allowing him a choice to Drink for offense/defense and using his skills for mobility/damage while reducing the number of Drink Charges on himself.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Fayde</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Reflection</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now reduces the target's Healing Received and Health Regeneration by 20/40/60% for 4 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This small change brings back some legacy effects onto Reflection.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Goldenveil</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Perch & Plunge</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> While perched on a tree, Perch no longer counts as an ability cast for certain sources (e.g. Power Supply).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This change is more of a bugfix, but it has more implications on Goldenveil's performance in lane.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Ichor</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Transfusion</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cast effect type changed from Magic to SuperiorMagic.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This allows Ichor to properly latch onto allies and enemies that have Magic Immunity.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Keeper of the Forest</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Nature's Guidance</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Camouflage will now only apply its root state on enemies when attacking out of stealth if the attacker is a non-illusion Keeper of the Forest hero (i.e. not his minions or other ally heroes).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Root duration reduced from 1.2/1.6/2/2.4 seconds to 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8 seconds.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Kraken</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Intelligence increased from 16 to 18.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Turn rate increased from 360 to 700 degrees per second.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Tsunami Charge</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Travel speed increased from 850 to 1000 units per second.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> A few small number tweaks for Kraken to keep up with the meta.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Monkey King</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Strength growth per level increased from 1.7 to 2.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Armor increased from 2.8 to 3.2.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> A small survivability buff to Monkey King to keep up with the meta.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Moon Queen</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Multi-Strike</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bounce radius increased from 450 to 500.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Lunar Glow</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Moon Queen receives 1.5x the damage bonus from this ability.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Moon Queen currently does not have a good enough reason to be picked over Forsaken Archer at the moment. These changes should help her deal more overall damage than Forsaken Archer if she is able to attack her foes.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Moraxus</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>More Axes</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown increased from 1.25 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The increased number of axes was a sufficient buff to Moraxus on its own. As a result, the cooldown of this ability is being reverted to its original values (prior to Patch 4.9.0).</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Nitro</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Ballistic</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mana Cost reduced from 15 to 12.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Blast Off</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mana Cost reduced from 100/110/120/130 to 95/105/115/125.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> A few minor buffs to Nitro were given as she is slightly underperforming. She should be fine where she is after these changes.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Nomad</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Strength growth per level increased from 1.8 to 2.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Agility growth per level increased from 2.8 to 3.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Intelligence growth per level increased from 2 to 2.2.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Edge Counter</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> On expiration, now grants 20/25/30% Damage Reduction for the next 5 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This state propagates to illusions he spawns while active.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes should give Nomad just the right amount of durability he needs without making him too frustrating to deal with.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Ophelia</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Nature's Wrath</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cast Range reduced from 800 to 600.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Duration reduced from 6 seconds to 5 seconds.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Command</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cast Range reduced from 900 to 600.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown increased from 8 seconds to 15 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Ophelia has been picked and banned more frequently in competitive matches, so she is receiving a few nerfs. She will still be able to dominate the early game, but just does it a little less effectively now.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Puppet Master</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Base Movement Speed reduced from 300 to 295.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Whiplash</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer passively grants Attack Speed.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Voodoo Puppet</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Voodoo Puppet's Max Health increased from 500/700/900 to 500/750/1000.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Damage multiplier reduced from 130/155/180% to 110/120/130%.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Leash Range increased from 1000 to 1500.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now passively grants Puppet Master 15/30/45 Attack Speed.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Puppet Master's burst damage as a carry with ganking tools has been too high throughout the history of HoN.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> With the latest free passive bonus Attack Speed on Whiplash and Elder Parasite being a new meta item pickup for Puppet Master, his burst damage potential has been dampened in favour of having a bit more sustained damage over time compared to before.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Voodoo Puppet is gradually becoming more of what it was originally designed for: a damage proxy for when the target goes out of range, and a proxy to apply Crowd Control to the target without being near the target. It can still be used to burst a target down at close range, but it is just less effective at doing so.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Elder Parasite will also be receiving a minor nerf in conjunction with this change, as the item in general has been proven to be a little too powerful after its recent changes. These combined changes should put Puppet Master in a better state than before.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Rhapsody</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Disco Inferno</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage dealt to enemies reduced from 20/30/40/50 to 18/27/36/45.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Healing per second applied to allies reduced from 13/22/31/40 to 10/18/26/34.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Rhapsody has been performing well since her changes in the previous patch. Her numbers on Disco Inferno were proven to be a tad high, so they are being reduced slightly to compensate.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Shadowblade</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Strength, Agility and Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.5 to 1.8.

<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Soul's Sight</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The first attack against an enemy hero in this form deals a bonus 20/30/40/50 Magic Damage and applies a 0.9/1/1.1/1.2 second Stun.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> After looking at Shadowblade's performance, part of his kit has been reverted more closely to its legacy form, while still allowing Shadowblade to leverage factors (such as the Attack Damage steal from Ancients and Kongor) without them being too good in those situations.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Soul's Sight now also provides more support-oriented bonuses to allow Shadowblade to have some capabilities as a support hero when underfarmed or when underperforming. Soul's Sight also gained a bit more laning utility to help Shadowblade perform better in this phase.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Mesmerize</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cast Range rescaled from 625 to 530/570/610/650.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes make Succubus have a little more reward for leveling Mesmerize, while reducing its Cast Range to a more reasonable amount during the laning phase.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Magic Damage changed from 650/750/850 to 550/750/950.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Witch Slayer is still not great in a competitive environment - these changes aim to keep him more relevant in the meta, while reducing the polarizing performance of Silver Bullet slightly (while maintaining it as a net buff prior to patch 4.9.0).</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Wall of Mirrors</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Wall of Mirrors trigger radius for Xemplar's illusions increased from 900 to 1200.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Xemplar's Wall of Mirrors also received some bugfixes (mentioned in the Bug Fixes & Optimizations section of the patch notes), which indirectly nerfs him to an appropriate power level.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Zephyr</span></strong>
<br /><br /><span style="color: #0099cc";>Wind Shield</span>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The Evasion mechanic from this ability now only functions against ranged attackers.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This prevents melee units from missing if they attack at the edge of Zephyr's hurtbox and Zephyr is currently moving away from an enemy melee unit.

<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Items </span>=
<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Barbed Armor </span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Duration reduced from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Returned Damage type is now the same as the received damage type.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Returned Damage percentage increased from 65% to 80%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The Returned Damage type change makes it so that the wielder of Barbed Armor will not reduce the amount of Damage Returned to their attacker based on the wielder's Armor/Magic Armor value (this was counter-synergy and was why Barbed Armor was considered a "bad item" in the past).</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Instead, the damage will now be returned of the appropriate type, so that the Returned Damage will be mitigated by the appropriate Armor type of the attacker (and not the wielder of Barbed Armor).</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Overall, these changes allow appropriate counterplay from the attacker's perspective without the effect of Barbed Armor being too strong, while still enabling Barbed Armor to do its job and scale appropriately as the game goes on.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Elder Parasite</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passive Attack Damage bonus reduced from 10 to 5.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Damage Amplification for damage received while the state is active increased from 12% to 15%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passive bonus Attack Speed reduced from 20 to 15.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe Cost increased from 600 Gold to 800 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total Cost increased from 2000 Gold to 2200 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Elder Parasite is supposed to be a mid-game high-risk, high-reward item for autoattack carries, and has been readjusted accordingly to fill this role. It was just a tad too good in the previous patch.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Lightbrand, Frozen Light, Searing Light, Dawnbringer, Grimoire of Power</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The Searing state is no longer applied in a 200 radius.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Grimoire of Power</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Debuff Reduction and Stun Reduction state duration reduced from 1 seconds to 0.6 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe Cost increased from 700 Gold to 1100 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total Cost increased from 5000 Gold to 5400 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Can no longer be activated while Perplexed or under a Forced Order effect (e.g. Legionnaire's Taunt).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Cooldown increased from 70 seconds to 90 seconds (becomes 72 seconds after its own cooldown reduction mechanic).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now applies an Activation Modifier state for 2 seconds, which prevents other Activation Modifiers from being applied while active.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now uses an Activation Modifier (i.e. this cannot be active at the same time as Shrunken Head or Void Talisman).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Grimoire of Power has proven to be an incredibly viable item pickup option in the game compared to Frostwolf's Skull and Geometer's Bane (finally). In fact, it is likely a little too good right now, as this item also allows you to farm better compared to its counterparts. Because of this, a cost increase is perfectly justified.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The active effect has been nerfed a little bit to make sure that it still does what it should do (allow the user to cast at least one final ability after breaking CC) without that duration being too long, as well as preventing items like Shrunken Head from being used to guarantee an escape.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Ioyn Stone</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Can now be purchased at the Outpost.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Iron Shield</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Deflection chance against enemy heroes reduced from 100% to 70%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This change allows the item to still be a strong pickup on melee Agility heroes in the laning phase, but does not enable their trades to be too effective.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Orb of Zamos & Grave Locket</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now only generate 0.25x bonus Gold when a non-player controlled Neutral Creep is killed by the corresponding Synchronized hero.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This item was simply not intended to synergize well with heroes that clear Neutral Creeps throughout the game.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Pegasus Boots</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now prioritizes teleporting to ally heroes before prioritizing other targets.
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Power Supply</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer has a recipe (i.e. it is a standalone item now).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now costs 200 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> No longer passively grants bonus Strength, Agility or Intelligence.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Max charges reduced from 15 to 10.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Can now be purchased at the Outpost.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Sacrificial Stone</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> New component buildup: Power Supply (200) + Major Totem (540) + Recipe (110) = 850 Gold Total
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Increased Healing Done adjusted from +10% to +15%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Health restored per charge increased from 10 to 12.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Power Supply now functions like the old Mana Battery - it was too cost-efficient for the stats it provided at the 300 Gold price point, and there was a need for the item to be at a low cost for its active functionality.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;">To prevent changing the item hotkey order once again, Power Supply and Sacrificial Stone were properly adjusted (rather than reintroducing Mana Battery).</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Veiled Rot</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now applies to the user even if they are invulnerable (addresses a corner case when respawning at fountain right away).
<br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Void Talisman</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe Cost increased from 960 Gold to 1160 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total Cost increased from 1500 Gold to 1700 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passive Strength, Agility and Intelligence bonus reduced from 6 to 5.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> While Void Talisman is active, your hero deals 25% less Damage.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Void Talisman now carries a little bit more of a penalty when used, as well as it being less efficient of an item when picked up.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> It should still be accessible enough to support heroes, while reducing the damage output of certain heroes while active.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> General </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Fixed a crash when the video card driver date cannot be found.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Gadgets can no longer damage Merrick's Rune in Mid Wars.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Automated Courier now plays its sounds on its own sound channel when the ability is activated.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> i.e. this no longer stops other sounds that are currently playing, i.e. the Rune Announcer.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mid Wars: Hero Ban mode no longer plays the "Ban a Hero!" audio clip twice.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Fixed various malformed XML entity errors.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Fixed a shader cache issue that causes the somewhat uncommon "Area of Effect Indicator" freeze bug for some users.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> If you still encounter this issue after the patch, please let us know on the Bug Report forums.
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Bots </span>=
<br />The following bots no longer print errors to the console:
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Maliken
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Ravenor
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> User Interface </span>=
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> If you decline to do an update, you will no longer be able to log in.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This fixes an issue where players may be unable to join a game or crash in the middle of the game if they chose not to update the game prior to playing.
<br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> The server name (e.g. "EU100") is now displayed on the Match Stats screen.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Removed the Facebook Stream button from the old UI (deprecated feature).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Fixed the Compatize button in the old UI so that it is only enabled when a replay is selected from the list.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Fixed the "Gift" button in the HoN Store so that it transitions to the correct UI window.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This prevents misleading information in the future (if we enable Gifting again) where you can gift a product to another user by using Silver Coins (which you cannot do).
<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Heroes </span>=
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Artillery</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Demon Hunter Artillery's LRM sound effects are now correctly played.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Circe</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mimic spawned by Twisted Visage is no longer able to use Whispering Helm to permanently control a creep after Twisted Visage expires.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Dampeer</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Terrorize's Fear mechanic now functions properly (i.e. prevents opponents from having control over their character for the duration).
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Demented Shaman</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Entangle's damage over time (DoT) state is now properly considered a debuff state.

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Prisoner</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Prison Break no longer performs a Physical effect type check every frame to determine if the chain should be broken (i.e. Void Talisman will no longer break the chains early).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Being Physically Immune at the time of the chain proc will still protect you from the auxiliary effects.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Additionally, the target becoming invulnerable will no longer break the chains.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Qi</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Enlightenment now properly deals SuperiorMagic Damage when boosted by Staff of the Master.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Rally</span></strong>

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Ravenor</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> GSL Ravenor has been properly renamed to Ravenna in the client string tables.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Rhapsody</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> 3D portrait positions for various alternate avatars have been fixed.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Swiftblade</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Counter Attack's active state no longer infinitely loops if two heroes attack each other when both of them have the active state.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Warchief</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Spirit Walk now properly stops Warchief's previously queued orders so he won't continue walking to a target location after casting (if queued to move towards a specific target unit).
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Xemplar</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Wall of Mirrors no longer erroneously applies a second instance of Magic Damage.
