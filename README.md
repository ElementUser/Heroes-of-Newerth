# Heroes of Newerth

This repository contains some scripts & tools that I use to make my life easier when developing & maintaining Heroes of Newerth (HoN). Some other tools that I use:

- Google Sheets available to the general public: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxfgW5wc6hfsbDFmRHdkems0R0E
*Most of what I did here are general mathematical/trend analysis for something before & after a patch, or game mechanics analysis in general
*One particular sheet assists me with managing the HoN Store & is semi-automatic in speeding up the process of generating XML files: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Va-Ye8GBHkLUiDfsliRr330c2qr_6lYQDiKOS677RzI
