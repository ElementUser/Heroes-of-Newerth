Patch Notes Formatter for HoN

===========================================


- Running patchNotesFormatter.py requires a patch_notes.txt file. Doing so will output two files: forum_output.txt and game_output.txt
- These two files contain the patch notes formatted specifically for the forum patch notes and in-game patch notes.
- Additional strings in the subheaders & ability name lists may need to be defined, since those are not obtained dynamically through an external source.
