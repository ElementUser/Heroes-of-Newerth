[COLOR=#00cc99]*[/COLOR] Cast Range reduced from 1000 to 900.

[COLOR=#0099ff][B]Hellbringer[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR=#0099cc]Summon Malphas[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#0099ff][B]Keeper of the Forest[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR=#0099cc]Nature's Guidance[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#ff66cc]-[/COLOR] Can now target ally structures to apply the Armor and Health Regeneration state (but not the stealth state).
[COLOR=#00cc99]*[/COLOR] Any damage a structure takes while the Backdoor Protection System is in effect & the appropriate conditions are fulfilled will not trigger the system if the structure's current health is greater than the "checkpoint" health value saved by the Backdoor Protection System.
[COLOR=#00cc99]*[/COLOR] Example: After a regular push (under non-backdoor conditions), a tower's Health drops from 1900 (max Health) to 1500 (this is the checkpoint health value). The If Nature's Guidance heals the Tower's Health above 1500 and an enemy attempts to backdoor & fulfills the system's conditions, then the Backdoor Protection System will not grant 20 Health Regeneration per second to the tower until it is below the checkpoint health value (1500). This bonus regeneration will only occur until it reaches the checkpoint value again - Nature's Guidance's regeneration will continue to take place throughout these events as intended.
