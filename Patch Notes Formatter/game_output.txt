==^960 Champions of Newerth (CoN) ^*==

^947-^* The new Champions of Newerth Season will last indefinitely until further notice.
   ^274*^* This can change at any point Garena & Frostburn Studios deems appropriate.

^947-^* All players will be reset to a base MMR of 1500 at the start of this Season (instead of starting off at a base MMR of 1250).
   ^274*^* This MMR reset combats all of the smurfing and stat manipulation that took place in the past, and the MMR system will be considered much more stable since it now uses the Legacy MMR system after the placement match period.
   ^274*^* Placement Matches will still have additional weight for determining your initial rank, but the weight from these Placement Matches is much lighter than prior Seasons.

 

=^075 User Interface ^*=

^947-^* Shadowpicking will no longer function during the Hero Ban Voting Phase of Ranked Pick (to prevent any confusion or unintended behaviour after the Voting Phase ends).

^947+^* The following changes were implemented from the MVP Mod (credits to EngineerT):
^947-^* Added a close button to the MVP window (so it does not obstruct your view if you wish to control your hero for a short time after the game ends).
^947-^* Added a disconnect button to the MVP Window (so you can disconnect from the game without having to navigate to the menu).

^947-^* As a result of the changes for this Champions of Newerth Season, the Ladder button has been re-enabled (since MMR will now really be "permanent" and matters a lot more than before).
   ^274*^* Disclaimer: the Ladder's displayed information may not be accurate & may need additional time to synchronize properly, or may need additional time & resources to fix the issue. There is no estimated time for a fix if this feature does not display the correct information.

^947-^* HoN Live has also been re-enabled to allow players to watch other HoN games once again!

 

=^075 General ^*=
