<br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Hero Rework - Nitro </span>=
<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #0099ff";>Nitro (Reworked)</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Nitro's fire-while-moving mechanic as a primary mechanic is conceptually broken/imbalanced and frustrating to deal with in this game. This concept simply does not work in HoN in a fair manner.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This results in making her high-highs too distinct from the other levels of performance, and also drastically punishes the average player who plays her while disproportionately rewarding veteran Nitro players.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Additionally, she was statistically impossible to balance, both in terms of power, performance and frustration levels.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> The rework maintains her hit-and-run mechanic and makes her kit much more fun overall, but allows both the Nitro player and other players in the game to interact with her more fairly.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> She even gets to keep a fun & balanced version of her fire-while-moving mechanic on her ultimate as a nice bonus!</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now has default auto-attack behaviour.

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>New Rune: Merrick's Rune</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Replaces Refreshment Rune in the game.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Restores 135 Health and 80 Mana over 3 seconds and is dispelled on damage (same as a single Bottle use).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Grants 35 Gold, plus 2 Gold per minute of elapsed game time (excluding the pregame time).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> When bottled, it refills your Bottle to full (3/3), behaving the same as a regular rune.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Previously filled to 2/3 when it was Refreshment Rune.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> If targeted via Ioyn Stone, the rune will be consumed and gives Ioyn Stone 2 charges (the same as before with Refreshment Rune).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Gives the user of Ioyn Stone the gold benefits of the rune immediately when this occurs. The gold benefits do not transfer to the Ioyn Stone charges.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Merrick's Rune is intended to replace Refreshment Rune. It solves the feeling of utter disappointment, as the player who gets Merrick's Rune will have much more of a compensation if they do not end up obtaining the primary rune that spawns.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Mid Wars </span>=

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Mid Wars is not a game mode where we want players to feel like they are under pressure and/or judge others based on their MMR. We simply want them to have fun & enjoy the game!</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> For the players who use their Mid Wars MMR as a measure of personal progression, your own MMR is still visible only to yourself.</em></span><br /><br /><br /><br />=<span style="color: #ffd700";> Heroes </span>=

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Making Static Shock proc more frequently should be an overall improvement to Power Overwhelming's charge buildup rate without it getting too out of hand.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Shadowblade's kit has a little too much early game power and survivability in high level play, making his snowball a little too difficult to deal with.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Additionally, the Gargantuan Form is still overly strong compared to the other forms, as maintaining the benefits of the base form while also having such a good early game survivability tool that scales well into the game was a bit much. The intention of the Gargantuan Form is durability first & foremost, and not to grant Shadowblade high damage upkeep while doing so.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Feint Form was also a little bit too good against enemy carries. In general, Gargantuan Form and Feint Form now have small downsides to them so the player thinks a little bit more about their form shifting usage.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /> 
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>New Item: Spyglass</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Given to all players at the start of the game.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Activate to bring up the targeting cursor.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Using Spyglass will transform it into harmless confetti at the target location.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Sells for 0 Gold (can be sold though).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Cannot be dropped.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Expires after 90 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This item solely exists for the select few players who are experiencing the AoE indicator lag, as there has not been a common factor among the tiny fraction of players that experience this issue & nobody has been able to pinpoint what causes this issue.</em></span><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Previously known as one of the most useless items in HoN's history, Spyglass makes its way back into Newerth and finally becomes useful to a small subset of players!</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Jade Spire</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Max Mana reduced from 400 to 300.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Mana Regeneration reduced from 150% to 115%.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Mid Wars only change: bonus Range granted to abilities increased from 100 to 150.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Jade Spire was giving way too much additional benefits upon completion for only 600 Gold. Toning down these benefits makes the item more in line with the benefits other items receive upon their completion.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Orb of Zamos</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> New recipe: Minor Totem (50) + Recipe (250) = 300 Gold Total (Total Cost unchanged from before)
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Strength, Agility and Intelligence reduced from 2 to 1.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Gold bonus for creep kills is now halved if the distance between the linked heroes is greater than 1500.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Grave Locket</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now requires a 25 Gold Recipe.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total Cost increased from 775 Gold to 800 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Agility reduced from 5 to 2.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Gold bonus for creep kills is now halved if the distance between the linked heroes is greater than 1500.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Experience granted to the linked hero per enemy creep kill reduced from 15 to 10.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Now only grants Bonus Experience to the linked hero for an enemy creep kill if the linked hero is not within the experience range of the creep kill.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These changes should help reduce the performance gap between solo laners in the unsafe lane ("suicide lane heroes") and the support hero of a dual lane.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Furthermore, both of these items were a little too efficient. They should now be considered less of a "must-buy" item as a laning support.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> In particular, Grave Locket was literally generating free experience if both laning heroes are in lane and killing creeps. This issue has been remedied with this change.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Refreshing Ornament</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> New recipe: Trinket of Restoration (350) + Minor Totem (50) + Recipe (150) = 550 Gold Total
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Agility reduced from 5 to 2.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Astrolabe</span></strong>

<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total cost increased from 1440 to 1550.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Agility carry heroes who picked up Refreshing Ornament for an efficient laning item that also granted them Agility, while upgrading the item into Astrolabe as an extremely cost-efficient survivability item that also granted them Agility was way too powerful.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Changing the components closer to how they were in the past should remedy this issue by quite a bit. Astrolabe was also too cost-efficient for what it did, so a slight cost nerf is also warranted.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Barrier Idol</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> State duration increased from 8 seconds to 10 seconds.

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Nome's Wisdom</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Magic Armor from the aura increased from 2 to 3.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Component priority changed from "Mystic Vestments -> Ring of the Teacher -> Manatube -> Recipe" to "Ring of the Teacher -> Manatube -> Mystic Vestments -> Recipe".
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Magic Armor items for pushing and teamfights were a little lacking.

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Spellshards (Reworked)</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Component Buildup: Perpetual Cogwheel (1325) + Recipe (825) = 2150 Gold Total.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Can be upgraded up to 2 times (max of 3 total levels).
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total Gold Cost is therefore 2150/2975/3800 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passively grants 150/175/200% Mana Regeneration and 5/10/15 Intelligence.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passively grants +10/15/20% Spell Damage against non-hero units.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passively grants 30/45/60% Magic Armor Penetration.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> This rework to Spellshards makes it less universally amazing for all heroes, while also properly gating its power behind a reasonable price point.</em></span><br />_______________________________________________
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Ringmail</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Armor reduced from 5 to 4.

<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Bonus Armor reduced from 6 to 5.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Armor addition/reduction when applied to an ally/enemy reduced from 6 to 5, respectively.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Armor reduction on self when this occurs is also reduced from 6 to 5.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Sol's Bulwark</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe Cost increased from 1000 Gold to 1050 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total Cost reduced from 1550 Gold to 1500 Gold 
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This is due to the reduction of cost in Ringmail.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Daemonic Breastplate</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Total Cost reduced from 5250 Gold to 5200 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This is due to the reduction of cost from both Ringmail and Sol's Bulwark.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Ultor's Heavy Helm</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe cost increased from 1000 Gold to 1025 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Total cost reduced from 3725 Gold to 3650 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> This is due to the reduction of cost from Ringmail.
<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Shield of the Five</span></strong>
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Recipe Cost increased from 200 Gold to 300 Gold.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Total Cost remains unchanged from before (800 Gold).
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Passive effect changes: Armor reduced from 5 to 4.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">-</span> Active effect changes:
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Duration reduced from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Plated Greaves</span></strong>

<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> Ally non-hero units now also receive the Armor bonus.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> These Armor items were a little too efficient early on, and Plated Greaves and Shield of the Five did a little too much as well. These adjustments should put them more in line with the game's general power level.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Icon of the Goddess</span></strong>

<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00cccc";>Ward of Revelation</span></strong>

<br /><span style="color: #00cc99;">*</span> The default reveal radius of 800 remains untouched.
<br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Counterwarding is a pretty one-dimensional choice when placing them: simply cover the most area possible.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> By reducing the radius of the intiial placement that gives vision of existing enemy Wards that are in fog, players now have to choose more carefully between optimal area coverage of possible enemy ward locations, or getting suboptimal coverage while revealing ward on high ground.</em></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #ff66cc;">+</span><em><span style="color: #ffffcc;"> Players can still technically gain the both these benefits if they have a hero that can grant temporary clearvision of wards, or if they purchase the Flying Courier from the item shop.</em></span><br /><br />_______________________________________________
