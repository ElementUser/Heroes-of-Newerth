Version 4.8.2
-------------
11 February 2020



== Design ==



= Hero Changes - Swiftblade =

+ Swiftblade gets his own section in these patch notes since he has a Staff of the Master change that pertains to a skill rework!

+ Counter Attack was an ability that was a result of an afterthought when filling the last ability of Swiftblade's kit.
+ By changing the ability to be more interactive and have practical use throughout the game, this allows the hero to be more engaging to play and transitions him more to a dueling playstyle!

 

Swiftblade

Counter Attack
- In addition to its current effects, now has a new active effect: Activate to block all incoming autoattacks for 1.5 seconds, while countering with Swiftblade's autoattacks against the next 1/2/3/4 hero attacks during this time.
- These counterattacks proc Way of the Sword.
*Note that this state is a Buff, so Blade Frenzy & other sources of Purge effects will dispel the buff.
*The passive effects of Counter Attack are disabled while Counter Attack's buff state is active.
*Note that Counter Attack cannot be activated while Blade Frenzy is active (since Blade Frenzy silences Swiftblade).
*Has a Mana Cost of 50 and a Cooldown of 23/20/17/14 seconds.

- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*If a hero attack is blocked, when Counter Attack expires, Swiftblade becomes Invulnerable for 1 second, and Counter Attack changes to Counter Strike for the next 5 seconds (800 Cast Range).
*Target an enemy to use Counter Strike, attacking & teleporting to them and applying a 80% Movement Slow for 2 seconds.
*Counter Attack's buff duration resets when the initial Invulnerability period ends.

_______________________________________________

 

= Hero Changes - Keeper of the Forest =

+ Ever since the readjustment of Keeper of the Forest's Animated Trees to comfortably kill Ancient Creeps early, Keeper of the Forest has been drastically underperforming.

+ Keeper of the Forest received buffs to compensate for this, and also received changes that accentuate his unique structure defense role & being a structural fortifier and healer.
+ Additionally, Keeper of the Forest received another boost from Staff of the Master. This time, it is his legacy Tree Sight ability!

 

Keeper of the Forest
- Strength growth per level increased from 3 to 3.3.

Nature's Guidance
- Bonus Health Regeneration per second increased from 1/2/3/4 to 2/3/4/5.
- Structures now gain an extra +3 Armor and Health Regeneration per second from this ability.
- Immobilize state duration increased from 0.5/0.8/1.1/1.4 seconds to 0.8/1.2/1.6/2 seconds.
- Units other than Keeper of the Forest attacking out of stealth now apply the Immobilize state for 0.5x the duration.

Animate Forest
- Max Health of Animated Trees from this ability increased from 370/430/490/550 to 390/460/530/600.

Strength in Numbers
- Staff of the Master effect addition (new):
*Grants an active ability that enchants a tree, granting 800 Clearvision around the area.
*The Clearvision persists as long as the enchanted tree is alive.
*Enemies can see an enchanted tree if they have vision of it.
*Ability has a 150 Cast Range, a Mana Cost of 100, and a cooldown of 30 seconds.

_______________________________________________

 

= Master's Legacy & Staff of the Master effect Changes =

 

Master's Legacy
- Cost reduced from 2500 Gold to 2300 Gold.
- Now grants an additional +5 Strength, Agility and Intelligence when upgraded from Staff of the Master.
*This item now grants a total of +15 Strength, Agility and Intelligence.

+ Players are a little bit too deterred from upgrading their Staff of the Master to Master's Legacy to help their allies.
+ Getting some bonuses for themselves while lowering the cost of the upgrade by just a bit should incentivize players to buy Master's Legacy without making it an obvious item to buy in the majority of their games.

_______________________________________________

Andromeda

Void Rip
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Cooldown is now reduced to 20 seconds (instead of 10 seconds).
*Magic Immunity duration reduced from 3 seconds to 2 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Artesia

Essence Projection
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Cast Range increased from 5000 to Global.

_______________________________________________

Tremble

Hive Mind
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Now also spawns the uncontrollable Shudder (the one that Tremble normally has without Staff of the Master) in addition to the controllable Shudder.
*In this scenario, the uncontrollable Shudder will be more transparent than the controllable Shudder (to avoid unnecessary screen obstruction & confusion).

_______________________________________________



= User Interface: Minimap Changes =

- When Player Colours are enabled: Hero icons in the minimap now have their icon borders match the colour of the player (for your own team only; the icon borders for enemy heroes will still be red).
- When Player Colours are enabled: also sets the Courier minimap icons to player colours (note that the Courier minimap icon colour will be white if Player Colours are disabled).
*Note: Player Colours can be toggled via the button above the minimap.

 

= Heroes =

 

Adrenaline

Shard Blast
- Cooldown reduced from 7.5/5/2.5/1 second(s) to 6/4/2/0 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Andromeda
- Attack Range reduced from 475 to 450.

_______________________________________________

Defiler
- Base Movement Speed reduced from 305 to 295.

Siphon Soul
- Cast Range reduced from 650 to 600.
- Mana Cost increased from 80/100/120/140 to 100/115/130/145.
- The link will now break if the target gains invulnerability or Magic Immunity.
- Movement Speed Slow applied to an enemy changed from 18% to -15/25/35/45 Movement Speed.
- Movement Speed bonus for self changed from 18% to 5/10/15/20%.

_______________________________________________

Demented Shaman

Entangle
- Now deals a negligible amount of non-lethal damage to its target upon being cast (to put Portal Key on cooldown, cancel Health Potions, etc.).

_______________________________________________

Gauntlet

Grapple
- Cast action time increased from 200ms to 250ms.
- Range rescaled from 1100 to 725/850/975/1100.

_______________________________________________

Glacius

Tundra Blast
- Movement Speed Slow increased from 25/25/30/35% to 25/30/35/40%.
- Movement Speed Slow duration increased from 3/3.5/3.5/4 seconds to 3/3.5/4/4.5 seconds.

Glacial Downpour
- Magic Damage per proc increased from 70/95/120 to 75/100/125.

_______________________________________________

Goldenveil

Perch & Plunge
- Plunge: delay before Goldenveil lands to apply the Magic Damage & Stun increased from 0.75 seconds to 0.8 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Gravekeeper

Corpse Explosion
- Max number of corpses exploded reduced from 6 to 3/4/5/6.
- Magic Damage per corpse reduced from 20/40/60/80 to 10/20/30/50.
- Base Magic Damage increased from 60 to 70/90/120/170.

+ Ever since the consistent area damage change, Corpse Explosion has finally not been useless. In fact, it was overperforming and was a free ticket to winning the lane if Gravekeeper chose to max Corpse Explosion.

+ Normalizing the damage in the early levels and maintaining its above average power at the max level of the ability will keep it powerful, but only at higher levels of the ability.

_______________________________________________

Master of Arms

Acid Bomb
- Physical Damage per second increased from 15/30/45/60 to 20/35/50/65.
- In addition to its previous effects, now also applies a 11/14/17/20% Movement Speed Slow to enemies on the trail.
- Effects now linger for 0.2 seconds upon leaving the trail.

_______________________________________________

Moira

Shards of Harkon
- Now has a 300ms Cast Action Time and 600ms Cast Time (as opposed to having neither of those).

Ephemeral Forge
- Portal Key on the mimic (if it has one) is now put on a 3 second cooldown when the original channeling completes.

_______________________________________________

Monkey King

Vault
- Affector linger time reduced from 0.8 seconds to 0.3 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Nomad
- Strength growth per level reduced from 2 to 1.8.
- Agility growth per level reduced from 2.9 to 2.8.
- Intelligence growth per level reduced from 2.2 to 2.

_______________________________________________

Nitro

Ballistic
- While Nitro and Mauser are together, projectile lifetime reduced from 0.35s to 0.25s.
*Projectile lifetime remains unchanged when Mauser is detached from Nitro.

+ Reducing the projectile lifetime should drastically increase the accuracy of her shots for less mechanically accurate players without affecting veteran Nitro players nearly as much. This should reduce the size of Nitro's performance gap between lower and higher bracket play.

_______________________________________________

Parasite

Infest
- Infested creep now receives +50% Damage from player-controlled enemy units (+25% Damage if Staff of the Master is on Parasite).

+ Parasite's Infest mechanic that allows him to hide inside a mobile creep has been incredibly frustrating to deal with since the hero has been introduced to the game (in the event Alchemist's Bones is not available to be used as a counter when engaging him). Every time Parasite is inside a creep, he basically has a second ~1000 Health bar that soaks up enemy crowd control and overkill damage from nukes with practically no cost to Parasite.

+ This change should allow enemy players to more quickly deal with Parasite's "second Health Bar" without it affecting Parasite's jungling capabilities.

_______________________________________________

Qi
- Attack projectile speed increased from 900 to 1100 units per second.

_______________________________________________

Silhouette

Shadow
- Like a Ninja (swap ability) changes:
*Cast time and cast action time reduced from 0.15 seconds to 0 seconds.
*Cast time and cast action time now increases by 0.1 seconds for every 1000 units between Silhouette and her Shadow (0.15 seconds for the first 1000 units).
*Max cast time and cast action time of 0.55 seconds.

+ Silhouette's relative safety for split-pushing and potential backdooring is much higher than almost every other hero's safety for most of HoN's history because her swap subability is a reliable and quick means of escape with an abnormally long teleport range (relative to other escapes).

+ Increasing the risk ever so slightly should increase her window of vulnerability just enough where Silhouette will have to be mindful of her overall Shadow positioning, or be extra mindful of the current situation and swap out earlier than normal if she wishes to be 100% safe.

_______________________________________________

Solstice

Graceful Strikes
- Day Time: Bonus Physical Damage per proc changed from 50/75/100/125 to 60/80/100/120.
- Night Time: Bonus Physical Damage per proc increased from 70/105/140/175 to 80/115/150/185.

_______________________________________________

Soul Reaper
- Attack projectile speed increased from 900 to 1300 units per second.

_______________________________________________

Valkyrie
- Attack projectile speed increased from 900 to 1100 units per second.

Javelin of Light
- Projectile touch effect type changed from True to Magic.
*This is actually considered a buff, as it means that Magic Immune units can no longer "catch" the Javelin & receive no damage and no Stun, which ends up blocking it for their allies without penalty.
*Instead, the projectile will go through Magic Immune units and no longer consider them as a valid target for impact.

_______________________________________________

War Beast

Metamorphosis
- Cooldown reduced from 115/95/70 seconds to 115/90/65 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Warchief
- Intelligence growth per level reduced from 2.9 to 2.7.

_______________________________________________

 

= Items =

 

Alchemist's Bones
- Gold bounty of the creep killed by Alchemist's Bones active ability changed from 3x the creep bounty to 165 Gold.
*The XP bounty multiplier still remains the same, so targeting a harder creep with Alchemist's Bones will still yield more experience.

_______________________________________________

Hypercrown
- Active ability can now be used on allies even if they are Magic Immune.

_______________________________________________

Rejuvenation Potion
- Cost increased from 300 Gold to 350 Gold.

_______________________________________________

 

== Matchmaking Maps & Modes ==

 

Champions of Newerth (CoN)
- Map: Forests of Caldavar ("New" for NAEU/International region, "Old" for SEA region)
- Mode: Ranked Pick

 

Mid Wars
- Hero Ban
- Single Draft

 

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

 

= Heroes =

Andromeda
- Void Rip (when boosted by Staff of the Master): Magic Immunity effect counts as an Activation Modifier (so the Magic Immunity portion of the buff granted to Andromeda cannot be active at the same time as Shrunken Head or Void Talisman).
*If you use one of these items and then activate Andromeda's Void Rip, the Magic Immunity from Void Rip will not apply to Andromeda at all. Note that this only has gameplay implications in the most niche of scenarios - most scenarios will still be the same.

Corrupted Disciple
- Electric Tide's inner radius offset was increased from 50 units to 80 units to mitigate cases of its hitbox being undetected by a unit that is moving towards Corrupted Disciple (in the event that one or both units have high Movement Speed).

Moira
- Units affected by Mana Sunder now regain the appropriate amount of mana if they have debuff duration reduction sources.

Monkey King
- Illusive Dash's initial cast is now properly detected as a spellcast by certain sources in the game (e.g. Power Supply).

Nymphora
- In the Mid Wars map, Teleport restriction boundaries have been adjusted to be the boundary that is roughly defined by the Tier 2 towers.

Predator
- Stone Hide's Magic Immunity effect now counts as an Activation Modifier (so the Magic Immunity effect cannot be active at the same time as Shrunken Head or Void Talisman).
*If you use one of these items and then activate Predator's Stone Hide, if the item's immunity duration runs out & Stone Hide's duration is still active, you will NOT receive the immunity effect until other Activation Modifier effects wear off.

Swiftblade
- Blade Frenzy's Magic Immunity effect now counts as an Activation Modifier (so the Magic Immunity effect cannot be active at the same time as Shrunken Head or Void Talisman).
*If you use one of these items and then activate Swiftblade's Blade Frenzy, if the item's immunity duration runs out & Blade Frenzy's duration is still active, you will NOT receive the immunity effect for the rest of the state duration. Note that this only has gameplay implications in the most niche of scenarios - most scenarios will still be the same.

 

= Items =

Whispering Helm
- Cooldown is now properly halved if the dominated creep becomes controlled by another source (e.g. Parasite's Infest).

- Players can now vote for themselves (for the time being, anyway).



== Design ==



= Hero Balance =

Aluna

Emerald Lightning
- Attack Speed buff on Aluna now has a max charge count of 3.

- Malphas' Destruction passive ability: bonus damage dealt to structures reduced from 50/75/100% to 30/40/50%.

_______________________________________________

Keeper of the Forest

Nature's Guidance
- Can now target ally structures to apply the Armor and Health Regeneration state (but not the stealth state).
*Any damage a structure takes while the Backdoor Protection System is in effect & the appropriate conditions are fulfilled will not trigger the system if the structure's current health is greater than the "checkpoint" health value saved by the Backdoor Protection System.
*Example: After a regular push (under non-backdoor conditions), a tower's Health drops from 1900 (max Health) to 1500 (this is the checkpoint health value). The If Nature's Guidance heals the Tower's Health above 1500 and an enemy attempts to backdoor & fulfills the system's conditions, then the Backdoor Protection System will not grant 20 Health Regeneration per second to the tower until it is below the checkpoint health value (1500). This bonus regeneration will only occur until it reaches the checkpoint value again - Nature's Guidance's regeneration will continue to take place throughout these events as intended.

_______________________________________________

- Ranked MMR on profile page now displays a whole number (i.e. no decimal places). [NAEU client only]
- Ranked MMR has been moved from the profile page to the Mode Selection Screen into the "Ranked" mode card.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

Orb of Zamos & Grave Locket
- Blue ring visual now only gets displayed to your team (and not the enemy team) when either of these items synchronizes to another ally hero.
*Prevents enemies from knowing that a stealthed ally hero is nearby.
*Note that the blue/green/red swirling light visuals around each hero are still not visible to the enemy team.

_______________________________________________


Version 4.8.1
-------------
3 December 2019

 

== Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes ==



+ This patch will be the first in a series of multiple patches that will focus on rebalancing Staff of the Master effects across different heroes, as well as focus on making this item's effects "worth it" for heroes that don't normally pick up the item (e.g. carry heroes), but can obtain the effect from an ally's Master's Legacy.

+ Additionally, some of the staler Staff of the Master effects will be revamped, and some new & exciting Staff of the Master effects will be added to the game!

- Bonus Movement and Attack Speed granted when Ballistic hits an enemy hero reduced from 10/20/30/40 to 10/15/20/25.

+ Nitro's excessive range and kiting capabilities were too frustrating to deal with in many scenarios for too much of HoN's lifetime, allowing Nitro to avoid interaction far too often. Ballistic's hitbox was also far bigger than its visual indicator.
+ These changes will force Nitro to commit more when attacking foes and force her to be more careful with spacing, while simultaneously providing her opponents more opportunities to properly interact with her.
+ Having less range means that it's actually easier to hit her shots too, so landing Nitro's autoattacks will be much easier for the players who don't normally play her.

= General =

- The previous changes for skill flow improvement in Patch 4.8.0 (Doctor Repulsor's Ludicrous Speed, Lodestone's Headsmash, and Prisoner's Shackled) no longer have their subability change to an activatable state if a non-visible enemy hero (stealthed or in fog) is within the ability's cast radius.
- The game no longer displays the following message when the following event occurs: "The creeps have grown stronger...).
*Prevents unnecessary screen clutter in the chat log.

 

= User Interface =

- Pinging items in an enemy's or ally's Consumable Slot in the bottom-right corner window will now display the appropriate information in your team's chat log.
- Stat columns on the post-game statistics page is now player-sortable for the new UI.
- A new stat column that represents "Wards Placed" has been added to the post-game match stats screen.
- The CoN Season Info button in the top-right corner of the "Ranked" mode option in the mode pick screen has been removed.
- Minor optimizations were performed for a few sections in the User Interface.
- Added Ranked MMR to the profile page in the new UI (NAEU Client only).

Version 4.8.0
-------------
8 October 2019

 

== Champions of Newerth (CoN) ==

- The new Champions of Newerth Season will last indefinitely until further notice.
*This can change at any point Garena & Frostburn Studios deems appropriate.

- All players will be reset to a base MMR of 1500 at the start of this Season (instead of starting off at a base MMR of 1250).
*This MMR reset combats all of the smurfing and stat manipulation that took place in the past, and the MMR system will be considered much more stable since it now uses the Legacy MMR system after the placement match period.
*Placement Matches will still have additional weight for determining your initial rank, but the weight from these Placement Matches is much lighter than prior Seasons.

 

= User Interface =

- Shadowpicking will no longer function during the Hero Ban Voting Phase of Ranked Pick (to prevent any confusion or unintended behaviour after the Voting Phase ends).

+ The following changes were implemented from the MVP Mod (credits to EngineerT):
- Added a close button to the MVP window (so it does not obstruct your view if you wish to control your hero for a short time after the game ends).
- Added a disconnect button to the MVP Window (so you can disconnect from the game without having to navigate to the menu).

- As a result of the changes for this Champions of Newerth Season, the Ladder button has been re-enabled (since MMR will now really be "permanent" and matters a lot more than before).
*Disclaimer: the Ladder's displayed information may not be accurate & may need additional time to synchronize properly, or may need additional time & resources to fix the issue. There is no estimated time for a fix if this feature does not display the correct information.

- HoN Live has also been re-enabled to allow players to watch other HoN games once again!

 

= General =

Well/Tarpit
- Well's/Tarpit's attacks now deal 1.35x damage to enemy heroes.
- Well's/Tarpit's attacks now have 25% Armor Penetration against enemy heroes.

Version 4.7.4
-------------
26 March 2019



== Design ==

 

= Mid Wars =

- Reverted all hero-specific attribute changes in this map & mode.
- Affected heroes:
*Accursed
*Adrenaline
*Artillery
*Bramble
*Cthulhuphant
*Dampeer
*Devourer
*Fayde
*Flint Beastwood
*Flux
*Geomancer
*Goldenveil
*Ichor
*Jeraziah
*Keeper of the Forest
*Kinesis
*Maliken
*Moira
*Monkey King
*Nomad
*Oogie
*Pandamonium
*Pearl
*Pharaoh
*Predator
*Prisoner
*Rampage
*Rhapsody
*Riptide
*Salomon

*Soul Reaper
*Soulstealer
*Swiftblade
*Tarot
*Tremble
*The Dark Lady
*Thunderbringer
*Torturer
*Vindicator
*War Beast
*Wildsoul
*Zephyr

+ Mid Wars hero-specific base attribute & attribute gain changes were mostly experimental. While the balance changes did make Mid Wars meta picks more toned down & led to a more varied picks, it ultimately meant that transitioning strategies from Mid Wars to Forests of Caldavar (and vice-versa) were made more difficult and less intuitive & consistent.

_______________________________________________

 

= Renamed Heroes =

Qi
- Hero renamed from "Chi".
*Qi is actually the traditional way to spell this word. "Chi" is the westernized version that was created so that it is more easily & phonetically translated for the purpose of easier pronunciation.
*Note that both are still referring to the same thing and are equally valid, and pronounced the same way. We currently do not have a hero name that starts with the letter "Q" though, and Qi looks a lot cooler!

 

= Heroes =



Apex

Fire Surge
- Magic Damage reduced from 65/130/195/260 to 60/120/180/240.

The Burning Ember
- Heal per second reduced from 4/5/6/7% to 3/4/5/6% of Apexâ€™s Max Health.
- Staff of the Master effect only: cooldown increased from 15 seconds to 30 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Balphagore

Corpse Conversion
- Minion Attack Damage reduced from 20/30/40/50 to 19/28/37/46.

_______________________________________________

Blood Hunter

Blood Crazy
- State extension duration when Blood Hunter autoattacks the affected target reduced from +1 second to +0.5 seconds.

Blood Sense
- Movement Speed bonus reduced from 11/22/33/44% to 10/20/30/40%.

Hemorrhage
- Cooldown increased from 60 seconds to 80/70/60 seconds.
- Staff of the Master effect only: radius reduced from 325 to 250.

_______________________________________________

Bombardier

Sticky Bomb
- Magic Damage increased from 75/150/225/300 to 100/180/260/340.

_______________________________________________

Bramble
- Starting Armor reduced from 4.6 to 4.

Ensnaring Shrubbery
- Movement Speed Slow for enemies reduced from 30% to 15%.
- Healing percentage of damage taken reduced from 40% to 30%.

+ Bramble's performance was a little too good since her rework in Patch 4.7.3. Ensnaring Shrubbery was a bit too overloaded with effects and somewhat overlapped with other heroes. As a result, the Movement Speed Slow and Healing percentage of damage taken was reduced.

+ Note that the ability still spawns a trail that increases Movement Speed for allies, so Bramble's team will still have a large net advantage in Movement Speed despite this nerf. It just makes the net advantage a little less one-sided in Bramble's team's favour.

_______________________________________________

Chronos

Curse of Ages
- Cooldown reduced from 1.5 seconds to 1.3 seconds.
*Still has a 0 second cooldown while Chronos is inside Chronofield.
- Magic Damage per proc increased from 40/60/80/100 to 45/70/95/120.
- Proc chance is increased by 3x if the target is affected by Chronofield.
*Curse of Ages is still using pseudo-RNG, so this does not directly translate to a 75% proc rate at level 4 of the ability in this scenario.
*What this change does is allow Curse of Ages to proc once every 1-3 attacks much more consistently while the target is affected by Chronofield.

+ With the Runed Cleaver nerf, Chronos started to underperform as well. Making Curse of Ages more reliable and impactful while Chronofield is active will help Chronos' damage output while he is attacking.

_______________________________________________

Circe

Doppelganger
- Cooldown reduced from 11 seconds to 10 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Dampeer

Terrorize
- Bonus Magic Damage per Essence reduced from 45 to 35.

Vampiric Flight
- Bonus Magic Damage per Essence reduced from 35 to 30.
- Base Heal to Dampeer for each target hit changed from 10/20/30/40 to 12/18/24/30.

Consume
- Bonus Magic Damage per Essence reduced from 35/55/75 to 30/50/70.
- Staff of the Master effects only:
*Essence loss upon death increased from 3 to 4.

_______________________________________________

Demented Shaman
- Base Attack Damage improved from 42-54 to 48-52.

Entangle
- No longer spawns any Shaman Minions.
- Physical Damage per second increased from 65/100/135/170 to 80/120/160/200.
- Tapering Movement Speed Slow max value changed from 50/65/80/100% to 40/60/80/100%.
- Tapering Movement Speed Slow minimum value reduced from 50% to 40%.

Storm Cloud
- Max Armor reduction on enemies and max Armor gain on allies changed from 12/18/24 to 8/16/24.

+ Demented Shaman's power is now slightly lower for the early game, while retaining most of his power in the mid-game and late-game. The Shaman minions were causing too much of a discrepancy in his performance, so they have been removed. To compensate for the damage loss, Demented Shaman received minor buffs to his Entangle damage & autoattack damage.

_______________________________________________

Doctor Repulsor
- Attack Range increased from 450 to 500.

Magnetic Contraption
- Magic Damage reduced from 120/170/225/280 to 105/160/215/270.
- Mana Cost reduced from 85/90/95/100 to 70/80/90/100.
- Cooldown increased from 3.5 seconds to 4 seconds.

Ludicrous Speed
- Now has a 0.5 second cooldown.
- The ability cooldown starts again after Doctor Repulsor exits Ludicrous Speed.

+ The Ludicrous Speed change slightly increases the time period where Doctor Repulsor is vulnerable, and gives opponents a realistic chance of disabling/killing Doctor Repulsor if he uses Ludicrous Speed carelessly. Enemy players will still have to have relatively quick reflexes and precision to do so though.

+ For those wondering: a 0.5 second cooldown is not long enough to erase Doctor Repulsor's viability from the game, please don't treat it as such. Try it yourself before making any judgments, it's not too long, nor too short.

+ The Attack Range and Magnetic Contraption changes make him more of a viable laner, but less viable of a jungler.

Jeraziah

Righteous Strike
- Cooldown increased from 7 seconds to 8 seconds.
- Bonus True Damage reduced from 60/80/100/120% to 40/60/80/100%.
- Movement Speed Slow reduced from 20% to 15%.
- Movement Speed Slow duration reduced from 2.5 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
- Cleave damage percentage of total damage dealt reduced from 40% to 30%.
- In-game role designation changed from "Support, Melee" to "Solo, Carry, Support, Melee".

+ Jeraziah's carry potential was a little bit too strong. The cleave effects were supposed to be add-ons that make him feel more like his HoN beta iteration and weren't supposed to be particularly impactful.

+ Some players still play Jeraziah primarily as a support. This is suboptimal, as Jeraziah should be played as one of the core heroes on your team since he needs to be on the front lines to actually make full use of all his abilities. This means that he requires farm, and should typically be played as a semi-carry at a minimum to have a reasonable impact on the game, which implies he should play as a solo hero or with a ranged hero as a lane partner. Jeraziah is meant to be a core hero first & foremost, with pretty strong support abilities as a supplement. He is not meant to be played as a traditional hard support hero, and some support heroes like Jeraziah are never meant to be played as a traditional hard support hero with very little items.

+ Here is an educational remark for players regarding Core Heroes. A Core Hero (i.e. a "Core") does not necessarily equate to a traditional Hard Carry (high autoattack DPS that scales with items and levels). This is an important distinction that many players do not grasp. Using the standard number priority system from 1 to 5 to represent general resource allocation for a particular hero on a given team, where "1" is the highest resource allocation & "5" is the lowest resource allocation, Cores are typically between priorities 1 to 3 throughout the entire game. Most hard carry heroes are priority 1, and most non-hard carry heroes fluctuate between priorities 2 & 3 depending on the game, hero lineup & context of the game at any given moment during the game. By the way, did you know number priorities for each hero may change over the course of the game? For example, a Behemoth/Magmus may be considered anywhere from priority 1-4 depending on how important it is for them to secure their Portal Key as fast as possible in that particular game. After that hero obtains their Portal Key, their priority typically shifts to a 4 or 5 (not always though, if they have to be played as a Core in that particular game).

+ For those who took the time to read all of this to become better players, now that we know Hard Carry Heroes are only a type of Cores (and being a Core does not mean you are a hard Carry Hero), it is a fact that most non-Hard-Carry Cores need a reasonably high gold & level allocation. While they won't hard-carry through hard DPS like traditional Hard Carries do with enough of a gold/level advantage, they end up doing a little bit of everything while having high enough survivability and high enough damage (plus their unique tools) to make them a threat. But they can only achieve this if they get a particular amount of gold & levels relative to your team & to the enemy team. Their positions will typically vary from 2 to 3 throughout the entire game. Core heroes are typically mid/late semi-carries, and examples include: Torturer, Defiler and Soul Reaper, since these heroes thrive the longer teamfights go for if they can stay alive.

+ All of this context is necessary to explain that Jeraziah will always be suboptimal as a traditional hard support hero, especially if he itemizes as one. He has very limited effectiveness in the back lines and needs to have enough durability and damage on the front lines to pose a threat, and this is why melee support heroes must be played as core heroes/semi-carries at the least to be effective. 

+ Basically: don't play Jeraziah as a traditional hard support hero, but also don't play him like a traditional hard carry hero. Play him as a Core Hero. If for some reason Jeraziah has to be shafted to priority 5, then at least get your survivability & damage up with cost/slot efficient items so that you can at least be in the front lines long enough to do something meaningful.

+ Finally, remember HoN is a dynamic & highly adaptable game, and while there sometimes isn't a definitive "best" resource allocation & "best" way to play certain heroes depending on the unique scenario you are playing in, there are certainly a number "highly viable" ways to play them, and a large amount of suboptimal ways to play them in given scenarios.

_______________________________________________

Magebane
- Base Attack Time reduced from 1.7 to 1.45.
- Starting Agility reduced from 35 to 25.
- Agility growth per level reduced from 3.5 to 3.1.
- Starting Armor reduced from 1.52 to 1.5.
- Base Damage increased from 13-17 to 23-27.
*As a result, starting Damage increased from 46-50 to 48-52.

Mana Rift
- Now also affects enemies within an area of 225 radius around the target without the need of Staff of the Master.
*Staff of the Master now doubles the radius.
- Now also applies a 0.1/0.2/0.3 second Stun to affected enemies.

+ Magebane's high Agility was problematic because of the high Armor value associated with high Agility in the late game. At the same time, Magebane has been statistically underperforming.

+ Rather than continuing to adjust his Agility in small increments, Magebane reacquired his low Base Attack Time (BAT, as one of the only exceptions in the game, due to how much it actually impacts Magebane relative to other heroes who had a low BAT. This allows him to scale much better with Agility and Attack Speed indirectly than other heroes without the side effect of drastically increasing his Armor late game. The attribute adjustments to Magebane are considered both a nerf and a buff.

+ The second adjustment that Magebane received to compensate for the multitude of nerfs to Magebane in Patch 4.7.3 (direct nerfs, and the Runed Cleaver nerfs and Ancients gold bounty nerfs) was a small buff to his ultimate to increase Magebane's contributions to early and mid game teamfights. The mini-stun was returned to prevent Homecoming Stones from acting as a free escape, and was overall a quality-of-life change for him. With all of these changes, Magebane should be in a more mechanically balanced spot than before.

- Ability can now only target non-player-controlled (NPC) creeps.
*Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the ability can still only target ally creeps like before, with the added restriction of it only being able to affect NPC creeps.
*Level 4 of the ability also still allows targeting of enemy and neutral creeps, with the added restriction that they must be NPC creeps.

+ This fixes an exploit where Plague Rider was able to deny high value targets from allies like Booboo and Shudder. However, on the grander scheme of things, Plague Rider has no need to deny an ally player-controlled creep since it is griefing almost all the time if done.

+ Although Plague Rider loses a little bit of utility against enemy player-controlled creeps later on (at level 4 of the ability), Plague Rider will still be a strong hero.

- Cooldown rate of increase for self for items and non-ultimate abilities reduced from 4x to 3.5x.

+ These changes should allow Warchief to use his abilities a little more frequently without the need of Warcry (with slightly above average cooldowns compared to the average hero), while also giving his abilities slightly lower cooldown than before while Warcry is active.

- Hero Ban
- Single Draft

 

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

 

= General =

- The HoN Live button is now disabled for the International (NAEU/non-SEA) Client to combat committed griefers by reducing the amount of game disrupting exploits.
*Report any player that is suspected of continuing to perform these exploits. They will be permanently suspended if found guilty.

- Fixed the Prophets map/mode by skipping the hero selection phase so that the gameplay functions as intended.

- Predasaur Crusher's attack animation now accurately matches the attack's actual impact time.

 

= Heroes =

Arachna
- Spider Sting's projectile models are now correct for each of Arachna's alternate avatars.

Engineer
- No longer displays a Staff of the Master visual if he obtains that state in any way (since he does not have a Staff of the Master effect on any of his abilities).

Kinesis
- Thoughtsteal's visuals are now displayed properly after the first time this ability is used in a game.

Nymphora
- The Well Invulnerability state (when a hero respawns) for heroes around Nymphora will now be continuously dispelled while Teleport is being channeled.

Version 4.7.3
-------------
26 February 2019



== Design ==

- Tributes to certain staff members have been put into some item flavour tooltips to thank them for all their hard work throughout the game!
*Go look for them! =)



= General =

Mystic Illusion Rune
- No longer stacks with Grimoire of Power's Cooldown Reduction.

Ancient Creeps
- Gold Bounty reduced by 20%.
*Dragon: 35-45 -> 28-36
*Dragon Master: 130-145 -> 100-120
*Dreadbeetle: 55-65 -> 44-52
*Dreadbeetle Queen: 90-105 -> 74-82
*Predasaur: 60-70 -> 48-56
*Predasaur Crusher: 70-85 -> 58-66

 

= Forests of Caldavar =

- Added 3 more extra buildings to each base (for a total of 7 extra base buildings).
*Slightly helps slow down being pushed by upgraded creeps.

- The entire upper-left area of the map has been filled with trees.
*Prevents the Legion team from having numerous approach options vs. Hellbourne top lane when ganking.
- Top lane and bottom lane's side path tree line has been adjusted such that lane wards have more visibility and flexibility.
- The tree space above Hellbourne's top lane Tier 1 tower has been adjusted so that its layout is more similar to the tree space below Legion's bottom lane Tier 1 tower.
*Each of the above points have been adjusted to make lane performance more symmetrical between both teams.

- Fixed a small pathing issue in a small tree patch to the bottom-right of Hellbourne's middle lane Tier 1 tower.
- The side paths near Legion's top lane Tier 2 tower and Hellbourne's bottom lane Tier 2 tower have been completely removed.
*There still exists a small side path near their respective Tier 1 towers to reward their opponents for destroying those Tier 1 towers and obtain a small edge in ganking near the respective Tier 2 towers. The level of ease to gank Tier 2 towers has been drastically reduced with the above change, however.

+ Overall, these changes lead to less areas with mass juking.

 

= Concede Mechanics =

- Under regular game conditions, time threshold for requiring 4 votes to pass a Concede Vote has been reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
*End Result: 15 minutes for 5 votes required to pass a Concede Vote, 20 minutes for 4 votes required to pass a Concede Vote.



_______________________________________________



= Hero Reworks =

 

Bramble (Partially Reworked)

Ability 1: Spore Breath (Reworked)
*Mana Cost : 100
*Cooldown: 14 seconds

- Activate to spew out spores in front of you for 2.5 seconds, dealing up to 100/175/250/325 Magic Damage over 3 seconds. Damage effect lingers for 0.5 seconds.
- After 2.5 seconds, anyone within the cone will be Stunned for 1.75 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Ability 2: Ensnaring Shrubbery (Reworked)
*Mana Cost: 60
*Radius: 275
*Trail Radius: 200
*Cooldown: 15 seconds

- Target an Ally (or self) to enshroud them with shrubbery for 3/4/5/6 seconds. Enemies around the target receive a 30% Movement Speed Slow.
- While affected by Ensnaring Shrubbery, taking hero damage Heals the target and all allies in a 400 unit radius for 40% of the damage taken.
- Also spawns a trail that grants yourself and allies 40/50/60/70 Movement Speed and Unitwalking while they are on the trail. Each part of the trail remains on the ground for 6 seconds after spawning.
*The ability can be double-activated to cast on self.

+ Bramble's previous iteration did not have a clear role. With the return of Ensnaring Shrubbery (while also having the ally speed boost effect of Enhanced Shrubbery) and Spore Breath, Bramble can now gank more frequently without his ultimate while serving as a durable frontline hero with the niche of mitigating Area of Effect damage through Ensnaring Shrubbery, all while maintaining reasonable damage with his current Chomp passive.
*Note that some numbers on Ensnaring Shrubbery were reduced due to how powerful this skill is after the rework.

=============================================

 

Engineer (Reworked)

- Base Strength increased from 20 to 22.
- Base Agility increased from 18 to 20.
- Agility growth per level reduced from 3.0 to 2.3.
- Base Intelligence increased from 20 to 24.
- Base Armor increased from 1.5 to 4.2.

Ability 1: The Keg
- Magic Damage changed from 70/140/210/280 to 80/140/200/260.
- Stun Duration reduced from 2 seconds to 1.4/1.6/1.8/2 seconds.
*The Mana Cost and Stun Duration are still a net buff compared to the pre-4.5.0 iteration of this ability.

_______________________________________________

Ability 2: Steam Turret (Reworked)
*Range: 800
*Mana Cost: 75
*Cooldown: 15 seconds

- Deploys a Steam Turret at target position facing the vector direction. The Turret fires 10 shots per second in a 800 distance, 400 radius cone while the Turret is active. 
*The Turret lasts 5 seconds.
- Each bullet deals 10/20/30/40 Magic Damage, pushes 10/15/20/25 units away from the Turret, and applies a charge of Suppressed for 3 seconds. 
*Suppressed is capped at 10 charges and each charge has its own duration. 
- Each additional bullet (i.e. charge of Suppressed) causes the damage and push to be reduced by 10%.
- The Turret provides 1000 day and night vision and is destroyed in 3 hits.

_______________________________________________

Ability 3: Spider Mines (Reworked)
*Range: 450
*Detection & Explosion Radius: 250
*Stack Limitation Radius: 700
*Mana Cost: 90/100/110/120
*Cooldown: 5 seconds

- Target a position to place a Spider Mine there. 
*Cannot place a mine if 2/2/2/3 mines already exist within target (Stack Limitation) radius. 
- Up to 6 may be placed at once, each dealing 100/175/250/325 Magic Damage.
- Consume one charge to place a mine. Up to 1/2/3/4 charges may be stored, refreshing every 15 seconds.
- Spider mines are stealthed and appear when an enemy comes near them, chasing them until contact.
*Each mine grants vision around itself.
*Does not block neutrals from respawning.

_______________________________________________

Ability 4: Energy Field (Reworked)
*Radius: 475
*Mana Cost: 200
*Cooldown: 105/95/85 seconds

- Places a gadget at the Engineer's location that lasts 6/8/10 seconds.
- The gadget takes 4 hits to destroy, and creates an Energy Field in a 475 radius around itself.
- Enemies who enter or exit the field has their buffs dispelled, takes 100 True Damage, and receive a 2 second Silence & Perplex with a tapering 100% Movement Speed Slow.
- Enemies inside the Energy Field take 50/75/100 Magic Damage per second.

+ Engineer's pre-4.5.0 kit was more versatile, enabled him to be one of the most viable support heroes, and gave him a good reason to be picked in a game. By reverting to this iteration, adding in some number adjustments, and adding a mechanic to Spider Mines that discourages stacking all of them into one general location (while still allowing for Spider Mine kills on enemy heroes that are injured enough), this iteration of Engineer aims to be the best one possible.

+ The reduced power of Spider Mines at level 1 should discourage Engineer players from stacking them up early on as well, and should encourage them to be used as a scouting and harassing tool early game instead of a kill tool.

+ As an additional note, the post-4.5.0's Steam Turret iteration was incredibly difficult to balance for a variety of situations. The pre-4.5.0 Engineer was much more stable for balance.

=============================================

 

Geomancer (Partially Reworked)

Ability 2: Earth's Grasp
- Magic Damage on initial impact reduced from 80/100/120/140 to 65/85/105/125.
- Magic Damage per tick changed from 15/30/45/60 to 30/35/40/45.
- Mana Cost reduced from 125 to 110/115/120/125.
- Duration changed from 4 seconds to 2/3/4/5 seconds.
- Cooldown changed from 19/16/13/10 seconds to 17/15/13/11 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Ability 4: Crystal Field (Reworked)
*Range: 1000
*Radius: 350
*Mana Cost: 200/250/300
*Cooldown: 100/90/80 seconds

- Creates a Crystal Field at target area, which is visible to all players. After 2.5 seconds, the field explodes and deals 300/450/600 Magic Damage to enemies in radius and Stuns for 2/2.5/3 seconds.
- Staff of the Master effect: Deals an additional 100/120/140 Magic Damage and applies a 50% Movement Speed Slow for 4 seconds in a 600 radius.

+ Geomancer's post-4.2.0-patch Crystal Field was too inflexible and was too easily counterplayed.

+ By reverting Crystal Field to its legacy iteration, Geomancer can take advantage of newly available tools (e.g. Sand Scepter, Stormspirit).
*This can be combined with his Geo Stalk ability to grant Geomancer much more potential and overall flexibility in his kit and performance.

=============================================

 

Tarot (Partially Reworked)

- Strength growth per level reduced from 2.4 to 2.

Ability 1: Ricochet (Reworked)
*Range: 600
*Area of Effect Radius for initial impact: 250
*Bounce Radius: 650
*Mana Cost: 100
*Cooldown: 15 seconds

- Target an enemy unit to fire a bolt that deals 75% of your Attack Damage + 30/60/90/120 Physical Damage and applies a 60% tapering Movement Speed Slow for 4 seconds to all units around the initial target within radius.
- The Bolt will bounce up to 2/4/6/8 times to nearby enemies within the bounce radius, dealing 10/20/30/40 + (6 x Bounce #) in Physical Damage.
- If Luck of the Draw is leveled, the initial impact and bounces can apply Critical Strike from Luck of the Draw.

_______________________________________________

Ability 2: Far Scry (Reworked)
*Range: 1000
*Mana Cost: 30/35/40/45
*Cooldown: 25/23/21/19 seconds

- Target an enemy hero to Mark them for 8/10/12/14 seconds.
- When you attack, your Attack will bounce to the Marked Target if they are within a 800 unit radius of your main target.
*If attacking the Marked target, it will bounce to the closest nearby enemy hero within radius.
- A Marked target cannot dodge attacks, has -10/20/30/40% Armor, and becomes Sighted and Revealed.

_______________________________________________

Ability 3: Bound by Fate
- No longer Reveals the primary target.
- Killing one of the 2 Bound units will once again snap the Bind to apply the pull, Stun and Magic Damage to the other Bound unit.
- Killing the Bound unit to snap the Bind will only apply 50% of the Magic Damage and Stun Duration to the other Bound target if the killed unit is a non-hero unit.
- Stun duration reduced from 1.6/1.9/2.2/2.5 seconds to 1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Ability 4: Luck of the Draw
- Critical Damage Multiplier reduced from 2/3.25/4.5x to 2/2.75/3.5x.

+ Tarot gains a lot of power and utility by doing this partial revert to her old iteration.
+ Far Scry is now back to its vanilla iteration with some tweaks that actually doesn't let it lose out on an extra attack on another target if Tarots attack her main target (instead of forcing her to attack a different target to maximize its use).
*This makes the ability actually intuitive compared to its vanilla iteration.

+ Tarot also gains some of her utility in Bound by Fate for laning power, except the effectiveness of the Stun is drastically reduced if she kills a creep to forcibly snap the Bind. This is a fair reward for the skill requirement to pull off - it was too ridiculous at 100% Stun Duration in the past.
+ Some of Tarot's power elsewhere in her kit has been reduced in power in exchange for better overall reliability, utility and damage scaling.

=============================================



= Heroes =

+ Most of the content in this section is maintenance numerical balance, with a few exceptions.

+ Note that some mechanical or hero ability reverts just aren't the best for HoN's current and future state. As much as certain players want those back, they cannot be brought back for the greater good of HoN.

+ This is still a net buff when compared to Patch 4.7.1.

_______________________________________________

- No longer loses Spirits when Defiler receives damage.
- Attack Damage for each Spirit reduced from 46 to 45.
- Base number of Spirits spawned increased from 6/11/16 to 6/12/18.
*Max number of Spirits with level 4 Power in Death increased from 10/15/20 to 10/16/22.

_______________________________________________

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master

Stagger
- Area Physical Damage increased from 40/60/80/100 to 45/70/95/120.
- Area Physical Damage dealt is now 1.75x against non-hero units.
- Now also grants 5/10/15/20 Movement Speed for 4 seconds.
*This bonus does not stack with Magic Brew's Movement Speed bonus. Whichever one grants more Movement Speed will take priority.
- Attack Damage bonus changed from 40/60/80/100 to 35/50/65/80.
- Cooldown reduced from 8 seconds to 7 seconds.

+ Drunken Master's older skill iterations cannot be reverted because they caused a huge amount of frustration for the opponents. Drunken Master is already a hero that is versatile in laning and performance throughout the entire game and has a lot of utility in his kit, so his kit cannot be overloaded any further without a compromise.

+ That being said, Drunken Master's Stagger now brings back some of his out-of-hero-combat mobility and improved damage against creeps. These general adjustments facilitate his creep farming rotations, but not to the extent of breaking his kit.

_______________________________________________

Electrician

Electric Shield
- Shield Health value 0.75/0.95/1.15/1.35x to 0.75/0.9/1.05/1.2x of the Mana Spent to use this ability.

- Cast Range reduced from 900 to 600.
- Magic Damage per second reduced from 125 to 90.
*Now deals 1.5x Magic Damage per second to non-hero units.
- Cooldown increased from 5 seconds to 9 seconds.
- No longer blocks neutral camps from spawning.

+ Emerald Warden now has his old 2 wolves on Hunter's Command back, as well as having the manual Overgrowth proc mechanic return to a realistically usable on-demand immobilize ability. There is still a small delay when activating Overgrowth manually to allow for a small amount of counterplay.

+ Note: Emerald Warden is still in a net buff state when compared to Patch 4.4.0 (where the wolf count on Hunter's Command was reduced from 2 to 1) and Patch 4.4.3 (before the overgrowth kill subability had a large delay before it can be activated after spawning an overgrowth).

_______________________________________________

Empath

Essence Link
- Removed initial instance of 10 True Damage & Heal.
*Still deals a negligible amount of non-DoT True Damage upon cast to interrupt certain states (e.g. Succubus' Mesmerize).

As One
- Cast Range reduced from 500 to 400.
- Bonus Attack Speed granted to her host reduced from 40/60/80 to 30/45/60.

_______________________________________________

Gauntlet

Infernal Instability
- Mana Cost increased from 70/80/90/100 to 80/95/110/125.
- Cooldown increased from 11 seconds to 12 seconds.
- Magic Damage reduced from 120/180/260/320 to 115/180/245/310.
- Cooldown refund if the state expires naturally reduced from 100% to 50% of Infernal Instability's default cooldown value.

_______________________________________________

Gemini

Fire & Ice
- Ice Wolf can now purchase items from an item shop.
*Items will be transferred to Gemini's inventory if there is enough space. Otherwise, it will go to the Stash as per regular behaviour.

*Note that neither Fire nor Ice actually have their own item inventories.

_______________________________________________

Glacius

Tundra Blast
- Movement Speed Slow changed from 25/30/35/40% to 25/25/30/35%.
- Duration of the Movement Speed Slow changed from 3/3.5/4/4.5 seconds to 3/3.5/3.5/4 seconds.

- Bonus Magic Damage radius no longer originates from each individual corpse's location.

+ This makes the ability's damage output more consistent, and is considered to be a reasonably impactful buff.

_______________________________________________

Grinex

Shadow Step
- Now actually Stuns the second target if it is an enemy hero.
- Stun duration increased from 1/1.2/1.4/1.6 seconds to 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8 seconds.
- Magic Damage on the second collision increased from 30/60/90/120 to 50/80/110/140.

Skrap

Unleash Vorax
- Skrap only gains 40% Gold Bounty when Vorax kills an enemy (non-player-controlled) creep and if Skrap is more than 1000 units away from Vorax.

*Default hotkey is "D".
*Shares cooldown with the base Meteor ability.
- Staff of the Master effect: for Meteor Strike only, allows the ability to be cast without breaking channeling.

= New Items =

New Initiation Item: Sacrificial Stone
- Component Buildup: Power Supply (300) + Pretender's Crown (165) + Recipe (435) = 900 Gold Total
- Grants: 6 Strength, 6 Agility, 6 Intelligence, +10% Healing Done.
- A charge is gained every time an enemy within 1200 radius casts a spell. 
- Active: When activated, all charges are removed.
*Restores 10 Health and 15 Mana per charge consumed.
*Max of 15 charges.
*Cooldown: 17 seconds

- On death, heals allies within 1200 radius for 50 Health.
- Sacrificial Stone glows after getting a hero kill or assist.
- While glowing, Sacrificial Stone grants +2 Strength, +2 Agility and +2 Intelligence, and reduces death timer by 8 seconds upon death.
*The glow dissipates after death.
*Death timer reduction does not occur in Mid Wars.

+ Sacrificial Stone returns in the form of the legacy Grave Locket with a few small extra touches, such as the increasing amount of Healing Done (from the second iteration of Jade Spire), as well as an area heal on death (tribute to the legacy Sacrificial Stone).

+ Its general purpose is to be a cost-and-slot-efficient early game stat item. It is slightly more expensive than legacy Grave Locket due to the improved baseline stats on it, having Power Supply's active, as well as having a few bonus perks on top of that.

_______________________________________________

New Weapons Item: Toxin Claws
- Cost: 300 Gold
- Passively applies Poison to enemies you attack for 3 seconds, applying a 12% Movement Speed Slow and dealing 6 Magic Damage per second.
- Poison only applies a 4% Movement Speed Slow and deals 3 Magic Damage per second when wielded by a ranged hero.
- This effect propagates to illusions for 33% of the duration.
- This item has a Freeze modifier, preventing its Movement Speed Slow state from stacking with the Icebrand line of items.

+ Toxin Claws is a cheap early game item to be picked up by melee heroes who could use the extra Movement Speed Slow and Magic DoT effects to either harass or help kill their foes.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

 

Barbed Armor
- Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.
- Mid Wars change only: Duration reduced from 5 seconds to 3 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Elder Parasite
- Damage Amplification on self reduced from 20% to 15% while active.
- Attack Speed bonus increased from 80 to 85 while active.

_______________________________________________

Grimoire of Power
- Cooldown Reduction reduced from 25% to 20%.
- Passive Magic Lifesteal vs. heroes reduced from 25% to 15% (10% to 5% vs. non-hero units)
- Active additional Magic Lifesteal vs. heroes reduced from 50% to 35%.
- Active additional Magic Lifesteal state duration reduced from 8 seconds to 5 seconds.
- Searing Magic Damage per second reduced from 35 to 30.
- Now only grants Ravenor 0.75x the Magic Lifesteal.
*This was the only hero of whom Grimoire of Power's effects were too polarizing on (not even Oogie was this polarizing), so a proper adjustment had to be made to make Ravenor's performance fair with this item.

_______________________________________________

Grave Locket
- Bonus Attack Damage while synchronized reduced from 10 to 8.

_______________________________________________

Hypercrown
- Recipe cost increased from 1000 Gold to 1300 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 4700 Gold to 5000 Gold.

_______________________________________________

Icon of the Goddess
- Base Health Regeneration per second increased from 2 to 3.
- Base Mana Regeneration bonus increased from 20% to 30%.

Ioyn Stone
- Can no longer be obtained in Mid Wars.

_______________________________________________

Orb of Zamos
- Bonus Attack Damage while synchronized reduced from 5 to 4.
- Bonus Movement Speed while synchronized reduced from 10 to 5.
- Bonus Gold obtained from killing an enemy unit and granted to your synchronized partner reduced from 10 to 8.

+ Orb of Zamos has been improving the performance of supports, although it has been doing so a little too much such that supports are generally the highest statistical performers.

+ As a result, Orb of Zamos is receiving some minor adjustments for the laning phase. This also allows for a better reason for heroes to upgrade to Grave Locket earlier if they wish to maximize the rewards of the synchronization mechanic throughout the game.

_______________________________________________

Plated Greaves
- On the active state: Base Damage bonus granted to ally creeps reduced from 20% to 10%.
- On the active state: Deflection granted to ally creeps reduced from 10 to 8.

_______________________________________________

Runed Cleaver

- Recipe Cost increased from 600 Gold to 900 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 4100 Gold to 4400 Gold.
- The bonus damage values against creeps have been changed from +60%/20% of your Attack Damage to +60/20 damage if the wielder is melee/ranged, respectively.
*Addresses a numerical inconsistency when upgrading Logger's Hatchet to Runed Cleaver.
*Note that this bonus damage value still does not apply to the Cleave damage. The only number that gets changed is the damage dealt to the primary target.

_______________________________________________

Spiked Bola
- Cooldown increased from 16 seconds to 22 seconds.
- Cannot be used on a target that has been previously affected by Spiked Bola within the last 10 seconds.

== Matchmaking Maps & Modes ==

 

Champions of Newerth (CoN)
- Map: Forests of Caldavar
- Mode: Ranked Pick

 

Mid Wars
- Hero Ban
- Single Draft

 

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==



= Forests of Caldavar =

 - Units can no longer traverse through the cliff area to the east of the Top Lane Legion Tier 1 tower without cliffwalking or cliffwalking-like properties.

 

= General =

- The Ladder button has been disabled due to players abusing an exploit.
*Results on the ladder are meaningless since a few years ago anyway, so this change does not negatively affect players.

- SEA Client only: MMR values visibility has been removed.
*The NAEU/International Client will still have MMR value visibility.

- Players should be able to 4-man queue again with the Old UI.
*Disclaimer: this is one of the only bugfixes that will ever be made regarding the Old UI.

- Fixed a bug with charging-related abilities from Deadlift, Legionnaire, Nomad and Solstice where using items that can target another entity and insert their action at the front of your action queue (instead of the back of your action queue) will change the target of the charge ability to the entity targeted by the item usage, when done after the charging-related ability has activated but before the hero has reached their initial target.
*As a result, these heroes are Perplexed while these skills are active.
*To players exploiting these bugs: please stop exploiting these bugs, as doing so has the potential to gimp certain heroes/items/mechanics every time these are fixed. Some of them could have unintended consequences like nerfing your favourite heroes.

- Power Rune now properly applies the Mystic state to the hero that picked it up.

 

= Heroes =

The following Heroes are now properly enabled in Tournament Rules:
- Artillery
- Deadlift
- Engineer
- Fayde
- Goldenveil
- Prophet

 

Arachna
- Broodlings (Spider Sting, when boosted by Staff of the Master) now have the models properly corresponding to its alternate avatar for all of the additional Spiderlings spawned.

Kinesis
- Hellbringer's Demon Strike now functions correctly when the ability is copied via Thoughtsteal.
- If War Beast's Summon Hellhounds ability is copied using Thoughtsteal, the Hellhounds now properly die if Kinesis dies or chooses to forget the Summon Hellhounds ability.

Master of Arms
- Overcharged Shot now properly displays the overhead stun swirl visuals on the primary target.
- Illusions now spawn with Master of Arms' current mode of Weapon Enhancement.

Monkey King
- Vault now functions properly when cast on a building at max range when Jade Spire is in your inventory.

Revenant
- Mortification visuals now properly correspond to Revenant's alt avatar when affecting enemy units.

Rhapsody
- Death Metal Rhapsody no longer plays a sound when knocked down.
*This primarily addresses self-Taunt spamming.

Valkyrie
- Azrael Valkyrie's Javelin of Light now properly plays an impact sound when it hits an enemy at far distances.

 

= Items =

The following Items are now properly enabled in Tournament Rules:
- Flying Courier
- Orb of Zamos

Hypercrown
- Illusions now properly proc the Chain Lightning effect.

Logger's Hatchet
- Damage bonus no longer applies on bounces (e.g. Moon Queen's Multi-Strike).

Restoration Stone
- No longer resets its own cooldown to 0 seconds under certain conditions while Mystic Illusion Rune's Mystic state was active.
*Also fixed with all variants/combinations with Grimoire of Power's cooldown reduction as well.

Runed Cleaver
- Damage bonus no longer applies on bounces (e.g. Moon Queen's Multi-Strike).

Spellshards
- Now properly applies its bonus Spell Damage to creeps.

Version 4.7.2
-------------
29 January 2019

 

 

== Design ==

 

= (Old) User Interface =

- Players now have the option to switch back to the old User Interface by going to Options -> Interface -> Miscellaneous -> New Main Interface and unticking the checkbox (requires client restart to take effect).
- Players now have the option to switch back to the old Shop Interface by going to Options -> Interface -> Miscellaneous -> New Shop Interface and unticking the checkbox (requires client restart to take effect).

*Since these are options for the old interfaces, bugs and the removal of certain features may occur as a result of using these options.
*Always do a client restart if you change these settings, as it could make your user interface unusable if done in a real game.
*Users who use these options use them at their own risk. Bug reports regarding these features will most likely be rejected, as these features are not officially supported.

 

= Matchmaking Rating (MMR) =

- MMR will now once again be displayed for each player on the hero pick screen (for both the Old and New User Interface).
*Rank icons and titles will still be displayed beside the MMR value.
*Note that the MMR system never actually went away, and only its mechanics were adjusted throughout the last few years after Champions of Newerth (CoN) started.
*Note that the MMR system is practically back to its legacy mechanics, and has been this way for 2 CoN Seasons.

 

= Concede Vote Mechanics =

- Now requires 5 players to concede after the 15 minute mark (instead of 4 players).
- Now requires 4 players to concede after the 30 minute mark (instead of 3 players).
*The above points assume an ideal 5v5 scenario in the Forests of Caldavar map where no other player has been terminated. The proper behaviour will take place if at least 1 player is terminated on the team that calls the concede vote.

 

= Forests of Caldavar =

- Two trees blocking a continuous side path from the bottom lane Tier 1 Legion Tower to the bottom lane Hellbourne Tier 2 Tower has been removed.
*Maintains consistency when comparing the side path from the top lane Tier 1 Hellbourne Tower to the top lane Tier 2 Legion Tower.

- The cliff ward spot closest to top lane Legion Tier 1 tower has been removed & replaced with trees.
*This addresses some of the ward vision inconsistencies between Legion top lane offlaners and Hellbourne bottom lane offlaners.



= Runes =

New Rune: Mystic Illusion Rune
- Replaces Illusion Rune.
- Illusion Rune has been renamed to Mystic Illusion Rune.
- In addition to the Illusion rune's current effects, now also applies Mystic for 45 seconds.
*Mystic grants 30% Reduced Cooldown and 30% Reduced Mana Costs.

New Adrenaline Avatar: Adrenaline High Roller
- There's nothing quite like the rush of hitting a jackpot, and the Adrenaline High Roller wants to share that feeling with everyone in Newerth. Despite his enthusiasm, though, not everyone enjoys his antics of splashing the pot and blasting them in the face with chips, cash, and coins. But once they get a taste of that high-roller status and he comps them a few spins of the roulette wheel, no one can resist the thrill of one more shot at the ultimate prize and wagering everything they have -- even their lives.



New Magebane Avatar: Sword Dancer Magebane
- The Sword Dancer is known throughout the high societies of Arasunia and Adkarna as the embodiment of grace and beauty, and her standing-room-only dance performances showcase the inspirational yet heartbreaking history of the Sang-La Mountains and the people who have lived and died there. This masterful performer is applauded for baring her heart and soul on the stage, but only she and the Shao monks know of the secret she will never reveal -- that her true purpose is to infiltrate the corrupt circles of the Legion's command, seek out Hellbourne agents and those who assist them, and give their black souls one final performance that will truly leave them breathless.



New Valkyrie Avatar: Azrael
- Azrael, the angel of destruction, serves as the ultimate guardian of the heavens and weapon of the gods when their enemies must be dealt with in the harshest manner, permanently, and the lofty beings do not wish to bloody their own hands. Throughout history she has stood as the final barrier between the heavens and the corruption that seeks to collapse them into the pits of All Hells, and now that the final battle between good and evil has manifested on Newerth, she brings her righteous spear to the front lines to once again -- and hopefully once and for all -- destroy the enemies of the gods.

Version 4.7.0
-------------
18 December 2018

 

== Design ==

 

= Support Heroes =

+ Hard Support heroes have had their power recalibrated to be more dominant between levels 1-4, but be slightly weaker (in terms of nuke damage) level 5 and onward (to prevent them from being outright better than gankers with their early advantage). This change further separates Support heroes from the rest of the hero pool and allows Support heroes to truly dominate the laning phase.

+ Some support heroes remained untouched due to their hybrid role nature (e.g. Witch Slayer being much more oriented as a support-ganker that is quite dependent on levels & scaling), while other heroes received changes that are outside these guidelines due to other factors (e.g. buildup of damage over time being outright buffed because it simply is not as reliable as burst damage, or being a special case that scales somewhat unorthodoxically like Martyr).

 

Empath

Essence Link
- Now also deals 10 True Damage to the target and heals Empath for 10 Health upon the initial cast.

_______________________________________________

Glacius

Tundra Blast
- Magic Damage changed from 80/130/180/230 to 110/150/180/210.

Transfusion
- Magic Damage changed from 70/140/210/280 to 100/160/200/240.

_______________________________________________

Martyr

Retribution
- Base Magic Damage increased from 75/100/125/150 to 100/125/150/175.
- Max Magic Damage increased from 175/300/425/550 to 210/330/440/550.
- Percentage threshold to reach Max Magic Damage & Movement Speed Slow application is now also increased by 0.3% for every 1 point of Intelligence Martyr has.
*e.g. if Martyr has 100 Intelligence, then the Max Health threshold to reach Max Magic Damage & Movement Speed Slow application is 30% of Martyr's Max Health.

Sol's Conviction
- Cooldown reduced from 45 seconds to 45/35/25/15 seconds.

*The same changes are applied for the Heal values when Staff of the Master's effects are active on Moira.

- Total Magic Damage changed from 90/140/200/270 to 110/160/195/230.

Nymphora's Zeal
- Magic Damage per impact changed from 50/90/130/170 to 55/90/115/140.
- Stun duration increased from 1 second to 1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds.

Grace of the Nymph
- Total potential Mana restored changed from 75/150/225/300 to 100/170/235/300.

- Magic Damage over time from pulses changed from 100/200/300/400 to 150/200/250/300 Magic Damage.

_______________________________________________



 

= Heroes =

 

Chipper
- Reverted to his iteration before 4.6.0.
- The following changes are now applied to Chipper:

Rocket Barrage
- Rocket speed increased from 1000 to 1200.
- Rocket touch radius increased from 70 to 75.
- Rockets can now hit neutral creeps.
- Rockets now deal an additional 7% of the target's Max Health in Magic Damage if they travel 2000 units or further.

+ Although Chipper's initial rework was incredibly successful, it caused a large amount of frustration due to his long range poke being too potent. Reverting the Rocket Barrage damage numbers back to how they were before and bringing back the (forced) synergy between Rocket Barrage and Tar Toss seems to be what players want so that Chipper can deal reliable damage with Portal Key once again.

+ To allow Chipper to have an additional option of having a long-range poke while still not allowing the long-range poke to be too strong nor too weak (and certainly not too frustrating), the Rockets deal bonus damage if they travel a long distance.

 _______________________________________________

Demented Shaman

Entangle
- Physical Damage reduced from 80/120/160/200 to 65/100/135/170 over 8 seconds.

Unbreakable
- Cast Range reduced from 550/700/850/1000 to 650.
- Cooldown changed from 60/45/30/15 seconds to 50/40/30/20 seconds.
- Cooldown if the state is dispelled while in Passive mode changed from 15 seconds to 20 seconds.
- State is now transferrable via Parasite's Facehug once again.
- When receiving fatal damage, now sets the target's Health to 120/180/240/300 + 6/9/12/15% of the target's Max Health (instead of preventing their Health to be reduced below 1 for 5 seconds).

+ Entangle was doing a little too much damage with the addition of the Shaman Minions, so Entangle's damage over time was reduced slightly to account for this.

+ Demented Shaman's Unbreakable in 4.6.3 overlapped with Martyr's Guardian Angel, so the skill was simply reverted to its previous iteration while still retaining its effects as a non-ultimate skill.

+ Unbreakable also slightly scales now to help compensate its original problem of being useless late-game if leveled early.

 _______________________________________________

Master of Arms

Weapon Enhancement
- Attack Damage penalty against heroes with Cheetah reduced from 24/21/18/15% to 22/18/14/10%.

Master's Call
- Attack Speed bonus increased from 100/160/220 to 100/200/300.

+ Master of Arms' power late-game wasn't enough to justify picking him. With these changes, he becomes noticeably more powerful than pre-4.6.2, but without the perks of obtaining massive amounts of Attack Speed by level 7.

_______________________________________________

 



= New Items =

 

New Item: Tome of Elements (200 Gold)
*Purchasable after the 10 minute mark.
*Initial Stock: 0
*Stock Refresh Time: 10 minutes.
- Activate to grant you 300 Experience, plus 60% of the difference between your Experience and your team's average Experience if your Experience is the lower value.

+ Tome of Elements is intended to be picked up by underleveled heroes on your team (typically Support heroes) to quickly catch up to the game's tempo, rather than becoming underleveled throughout the entire game.

+ Tome of Elements has little to no benefits for carry or ganker class heroes if they are close to/above their team's average Experience, as the item adds bonus Experience based on the difference between your Experience and your team's average Experience if your Experience is the lower value.

+ This item (and its blessings) has been brought to you by ElementUser himself! <3

_______________________________________________

 

= Items =

 

Bottle
- Cost increased from 600 Gold to 650 Gold.

+ This change prevents players from buying it directly at the start of the game.
*Also mitigates the frequency of pooling a Bottle to another ally hero from the start of the game.

 

Null Stone
- New Active: Transfers your spell negation ability to another ally hero for up to 15 seconds.

+ Heroes who pick up this item now have the option to transfer the Spell Negation effect to another ally hero!

 _______________________________________________

Homecoming Stone
- Cooldown increased from 65 seconds to 80 seconds.

+ Homecoming Stone was being used as a cheap mobility tool to quickly teleport to other lanes for farming rotations, and Post Haste's niche fell out of favour after the introduction of the 2x consumables slot. Adjusting the cooldown of Homecoming Stone resolves both of these respective issues.

After witnessing just how much damage his brother in magma is capable of on the battlefield, Diamante knows the first step in securing the future of Newerth is to return Magmus to a molten state -- permanently.

Version 4.6.3
-------------
27 November 2018

 

 

== Design ==



= Hero Reworks =

 

Demented Shaman (Reworked)

Ability 1: Entangle
*Range: 700
*Mana Cost: 80/90/100/110
*Cooldown: 15/13/11/9 seconds

- Target an enemy unit to apply a Mini-Stun and a 70/80/90/100% Movement Speed Slow for 2 seconds.
- Afterwards, applies a 0/0.5/1/1.5 second Stun and deals 80/120/160/200 Physical Damage over 8 seconds.
- Also spawns 2 Shaman Minions around the target for 4 seconds, dealing 10 Attack Damage per attack.

 

Ability 2: Healing Wave
*Range: 750
*Mana Cost: 80/90/100/110
*Cooldown: 12/10/8/6 seconds

- Target an Ally (or self) to launch a wave which chains to the nearest 3/4/5/6 friendly targets.
- Affected ally units are Healed for 80/100/120/140 Health and deal 80/100/120/140 Physical Damage to enemy units around themselves.

 

Ability 3: Unbreakable
*Range: 550/700/850/1000
*Mana Cost: 150
*Cooldown: 60/45/30/15 seconds

- Target an Ally (or self) to apply Unbreakable to them for 5 seconds. While active, the target cannot die (health will not go below 1) and gains 15/30/45/60 bonus Damage.
- When not on cooldown or not on another target, Unbreakable remains active indefinitely on Demented Shaman until he takes fatal damage, upon which it will expire 2 seconds after that occurs. While active passively, Unbreakable does not grant bonus damage.

 

Ability 4: Storm Cloud
*Range: 2000
*Radius: 575
*Mana Cost: 100
*Cooldown: 40 seconds

- Target a location to apply Storm Cloud to all heroes in the area for 24 seconds. 
- Enemies lose Armor per second until -12/18/24 Armor, then regains it over the rest of the duration.
- Allies gain Armor per second until 12/18/24 Armor, then loses it over the rest of the duration.

 

+ Demented Shaman had his fair share of problems. Healing Wave always required ally assistance to (usually) improve the damage only by a mediocre amount, while the initially reworked Storm Cloud mechanics were incredibly underwhelming.

+ By addressing these issues and making Unbreakable a regular skill that is impactful & has a niche, Demented Shaman will be much more fluid & fun to play.

_______________________________________________



= Heroes =

 

Andromeda

Ability 3: Dimensional Link (Reworked)
- Passively gains 10/15/20/25 Attack Damage.
- Gain 650/850/1050/1250 Attack Range against anyone you have cast a spell on for the last 3 seconds, and grants Sight of them for 3 seconds.

Void Rip
- Now also applies a 10/20/30% Movement Speed Slow for 4 seconds to the target if it is an enemy.
- Now also increases your Movement Speed by 10/20/30% and matches Comet's Cast Range to Void Rip's Cast Range for 4 seconds.

+ Andromeda's Dimensional Link aura is fairly generic, and was characteristic of her original port from Vengeful Spirit (which was based off Warcraft 3's Command Aura skill, which was a generic attack-boosting aura).

+ With the new Dimensional Link ability, Andromeda's lane harass becomes potent. Coupled with the changes to Void Rip, she can also follow up by allowing her to perform autoattacks against an enemy she targets with Void Rip.

_______________________________________________

Berzerker

- Agility gain per level reduced from 2.0 to 1.7.

Carnage
- Stun and Debuff duration reduction effects no longer stack with other sources (e.g. Shaman's Headdress, Barrier Idol).
- Stun and Debuff duration reduction changed from 40/60/80% to 40/55/70%.

+ Berzerker's anti-crowd-control effects were a little too good (especially if you make it stack with other sources of anti-crowd-control). These changes should make him slightly easier to deal with.

_______________________________________________

Glacius

Glacial Downpour
- Magic Damage per shard reduced from 80/110/140 to 75/100/125.

+ Glacius' performance is generally where it should be, although he is winning just slightly too much. Glacial Downpour's damage output now scales a little bit less towards late-game, while still maintaining its early-game and mid-game power.

_______________________________________________

Master of Arms

Acid Bomb
- Damage multiplier vs. non-hero units increased from 0.5x to 0.75x.

Weapon Enhancement
- Attack Damage penalty against heroes with Cheetah increased from 10% to 24/21/18/15%.
- Attack Damage bonus on Bulldozer increased from 0/5/10/15/20 to 0/7/13/19/25.

Master's Call
- The bonus Attack Speed/Attack Damage state is now applied to Master of Arms for 20 seconds upon cast (as a separate state from the Shield).
*This state is unpurgeable.
- Cooldown reduced from 60 seconds to 60/50/40 seconds.
- Attack Speed bonus (from the active state) while the Cheetah gun is active increased from 100/150/200 to 100/160/220.

+ It was very clear that the aim of the previous nerfs to Master of Arms was to prevent him from having no weakness at all phases of the game by removing 100% uptime on Cheetah's Attack Speed. The changes did fulfill their goal, but was a little heavyhanded.

+ The new changes separate Master's Call's Shield state from the Attack Speed/Attack Damage state, allowing him to regain a good uptime on Cheetah's old strengths without the uptime being close to 100%.

+ Master of Arms' power curve should now follow a traditional carry's power curve a little bit better and gradually becomes stronger late game, rather than simply being good at all phases of the game.

_______________________________________________

Rampage

Stampede
- When the main target dies or orderdisjoints (e.g. via using Geometer's Bane) before Stampede starts the pounce state, Rampage is put on a 10 second cooldown (increased from 5 seconds) instead of its default cooldown value.

Might of the Herd
- Max Shield Health reduced from 60/80/100/120 to 40/60/80/100.
*Shield's rate of increase has been adjusted to compensate.

+ Rampage has been slightly overperforming after Patch 4.6.1, so these changes were made to adjust for this fact.

_______________________________________________

 

= Items =

 

Voltstone
- Cost increased from 600 Gold to 700 Gold. 

+ Voltstone received a cost increase due to lane creep bounty being increased (and was not adjusted in conjunction with the change like Runed Cleaver was). This change also prevents players from picking it up as a starting item.

The prototype held great promise until the Hellbourne captured it and brought about the time-traveling fiend known as Chronos. Little Benny has carried a crushing guilt since that day, as it was her mastery over the mechanics of time that imbued him with such devastating powers, and her mission has been to track him down on the battlefield and forcefully extract her contributions, which include the intricate springs, gears, and winding mechanism within his armor. This would, of course, leave him an empty shell of broken pieces, which is just fine with Little Benny. The bell tolls for thee, Chronos!

 

New Nymphora Avatar: Hummingbird Nymphora
- The beautiful and graceful Hummingbird Nymphs are perfectly content perching in the Sefir Tree and making occasional flights into the nearby blossom fields to sip the gloriously sweet nectar, but when their food source is endangered by any threat â€“ daemons, corruption, even the boots of Legion battalions â€“ the transgressors quickly learn how it feels to be on the wrong side of blurred wings, pollen bombs, and a disposition so sweet it's scary.

 

New Sapphire Avatar: Geosynch Sapphire
- With the recent discovery of undamaged solar-powered satellites still orbiting Newerth from the time of the Lost Civilization, brave warriors are being recruited to journey into the unknown realm of space to determine if these technological wonders can be used in the war against the Hellbourne. Geosynch Sapphire has been drafted into the new Galactic Legion with the hopes that the satellites will work with her crystals to magnify their powerful abilities -- both protective and destructive -- to augment the Legion's efforts from a place the Hellbourne can't hope to reach.

Version 4.6.2
-------------
6 November 2018

 

 

== Design ==

 

= General =

Gold Changes
- Melee Lane Creep Gold Bounty reduced from 45-55 to 40-50.
- Ranged Lane Creep Gold Bounty reduced from 45-55 to 40-50.
- Siege Lane Creep Gold Bounty increased from 56-80 to 60-80. 

+ Although we wanted to encourage staying in lane for longer periods of time to mitigate the effectiveness of deathballs/"pubtrains" that occur too early (as well as emphasize the importance of last-hitting even more), the gold gain rate has been accelerated a little too much & favours snowballing too much from merely obtaining a lane lead.

+ As a result, the Gold Bounty from Lane Creeps have been reduced slightly, but still give 4 more gold on average compared to the values before patch 4.5.2 (which is about a net 10% increase in Gold Bounty as opposed to a 20% net increase).

 

Kongor & Hell Kongor
- Starting Attack Damage increased from 60 to 70.

+ The Bosses were doing slightly too little damage since the previous patch, so their Attack Damage values have been adjusted accordingly.

 

_______________________________________________



= Heroes =

Bushwack

Jungle Toxin
- Physical Damage per second is now capped at 100 on Bosses.

+ Players were expressing that Bushwack is a problem in the new meta. This change makes it much more difficult for Bushwack to solo Kongor early on - he will likely require an ally to help kite/tank for him to sustain Jungle Toxin's DPS on Kongor (which, by the way, only has a ~1s re-application window because Kongor & Hell Kongor have high debuff duration reduction).

_______________________________________________

Master of Arms

Acid Bomb
- Now only deals 0.5x the Physical Damage per second to non-hero units.

Weapon Enhancement
- Attack Speed bonus on Cheetah reduced from 0/100/175/250/325 to 0/40/60/80/100.
- Attack Damage penalty against heroes with Cheetah reduced from 20% to 10%.
- Attack Damage bonus on Bulldozer reduced from 0/10/20/30/40 to 0/5/10/15/20.

Master's Call
- Attack Speed bonus (from the active state) while the Cheetah gun is active increased from 50/100/150 to 100/150/200.
- Attack Damage bonus (from the active state) while the Bulldozer gun is active increased from 20/40/60 to 40/70/100.

+ Master of Arms has too many upsides that cover all of his weaknesses adequately, while also maintaining all of the strengths of a carry with great scaling and quick farm speed.

+ As a result, the area damage from Acid Bomb has been reduced significantly against creeps, and a significant portion of Master of Arms' damage output has been moved to the active state of Master's Call, which significantly reduces the 100% uptime on his heightened damage output.

_______________________________________________

Rampage

Stampede
- No longer has the auto-switch target mechanic.
- Instead, when the main target dies or orderdisjoints (e.g. via using Geometer's Bane) before Stampede starts the pounce state, Rampage is put on a 5 second cooldown instead of its default cooldown value.

Ability 2: Might of the Herd (Reworked)
- Renamed from Tough Hide.
- In addition to Tough Hide's benefits, now also grants 4/6/8/10% Movement Speed, and gains 4/6/8/10% of Movement Speed in Attack Damage.
- Max HP granted by moving reduced from 60/120/180/240 to 60/80/100/120.
- Shield Health increased per 100 distance traveled changed from 2/4/6/8 to 3/4/5/6.

+ Stampede had to be changed due to various players abusing a gamebreaking bug (of some form) on Rampage. To all those who genuinely enjoyed playing Rampage and Stampede's auto-target-switching behaviour, you can blame the players who exploited the gamebreaking bugs on Stampede.

+ To compensate, Tough Hide has been renamed to its legacy name (Might of the Herd), and now provides some of the benefits the legacy skill offered (since it is a rather lackluster ability). The shield does not need a high health cap & its purpose is meant to be residual defense gained while moving.

_______________________________________________

Shellshock

Fireflies
- Magic Damage reduced from 100/150/200/250 to 100/140/180/220.

+ Shellshock has been slightly overperforming for a long period of time since his most recent buffs. This adjustment should bring his performance back where we initially wanted it to be.

_______________________________________________

 

= Items =

Arcane Bomb
- Against enemy illusions, now removes 900 Health or 75% of the target's Max Health (whichever is higher), instead of dealing 900 Magic Damage.
*Health Removal in this manner is lethal.

+ Arcane Bomb's primary purpose seemed to be lacking later in the game when enemy heroes get more survivability and increased Magic Armor. This change helps its effectiveness be retained later in the game, which is when illusions do start to become a big problem.

_______________________________________________

Behemoth's Heart
- Recipe cost reduced from 800 Gold to 500 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 5100 Gold to 4800 Gold.
- Health Regeneration per second increased from 0.75% to 1% of your Max Health.

Bloodborne Maul
- Max Charges reduced from 350 to 120.
- Strength bonus reduced from 45 to 35.

+ Strength carries (which have good early-game performance as well as late-game performance) are too enabled by this item, and this item has been far too powerful for such a long time because it gives both survivability and damage in the same item to such a high extent (and also dwarfs the purpose of Behemoth's Heart). In fact, multiple players still pick up this item even if they aren't a Strength hero and still dominate, so the item is being toned down significantly.

+ As a result, Behemoth's Heart also received a small buff.

 _______________________________________________

Runed Cleaver
- Recipe Cost reduced from 975 Gold to 600 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 4475 to 4100 Gold.

+ The cost of Runed Cleaver decreases at roughly the same proportion as the Gold Bounty changes in this patch, since this item is pivotal to certain heroes' farming performance throughout the game.

New Maliken Avatar: Volto Maliken
- The annual Carnival of Adkarna festival thrown by the city's elite originated as a celebration of Maliken Grimm's victory over the Savages and thereby uniting all of Man under his banner. The tradition has continued long after Grimm's betrayal of the Legion, as humans can justify nearly any reason to don disguises and engage in highly questionable behavior, and the Carnival has morphed into a vague celebration of Man's perseverance over general misery and anguish. Among the lavish private parties thrown every year, the one hosted by the ridiculously wealthy merchant Volto is considered the best, and the nobles cannot recall a time when attendance at Volto's masquerade ball wasn't absolutely required to maintain top social status. They cannot recall that time, because it never existed. Volto was there at the very first Carnival, and he is among the most insidious sort of daemon -- the sort who blends in perfectly with his prey and caters to their wants, needs, desires, and egos, making them feel like royalty among their peers just by sparing a moment to chat with them at his luxurious ball.

But every year, for a small, select group -- those targeted for their influence in various aspects of the Legion -- that chat leads to a whisper, a beckoning to deeper chambers for a more private encounter, and only there does Volto reveal his true form with daemonic zeal. And while the hapless nobles targeted for assassination are torn apart by Volto's claws, their friends and family continue to drink his wine, eat his food, and revel in the debauchery of the annual Carnival of Adkarna.

 

New Monkey King Avatar: Prodigy King
- The whiz kid could always see the underlying systems at work behind any mathematical problem, and it didn't take him long to discover that every problem was mathematical -- it was a simple matter of applying the necessary physics and deconstructing the issues until he'd found the nucleus, the core issue, and solving it. This was both encouraging and infuriating for his professors, who saw enormous potential in the lad but sometimes found his arrogance and constant perfectionism -- plus the fact that he was never wrong -- insufferable. When the prodigy became bored with his doctorate-level classes at the Adkarna Academy, one of his more frustrated instructors suggested he explore the military courses available to those interested in joining the Legion forces as officers. The boy dismissed this laughable notion at first -- one needn't be a genius to swing an over-sized letter opener -- but his brain constantly craved new and interesting information, and his curiosity eventually carried him to the Applied Research: Warfare wing of the campus. There, he had the stunning revelation that battle is math. Angles, speed, collisions, momentum -- all of it could be planned, prepared, and executed for a certain victory. And when he discovered that chaos was the fuel that powered the math, he was hopelessly lost in trying solve the problem of the perfect combination of tactics and strategy to win the war against the Hellbourne. And now that he has a theory, it's time to test it...

 

New Swiftblade Avatar: Suzaku Swiftblade
- The Suzaku is a legendary guardian of the southern Sang-La Mountains, a heavenly bird made of flames who blesses a chosen warrior with incredible speed, strength, and fiery blades so they may serve as the embodiment of justice and vigilance. This was of course known to the young female student at the Adkarna Academy -- all of the silly celestial beings from her homeland were required learning in her Astrology course -- but when she came across a classmate being bullied by a group of older students, Suzaku was the furthest thing from her mind. All she wanted to do was protect the poor child from further torment, and without concern for her own safety she plunged into the fray. This was exactly what Suzaku looked for in an exemplar, and the schoolgirl, on the verge of serious harm from the bullies, suddenly found herself moving in a blur of flames as she slashed through the aggressors, sending them limping and scurrying away. This would be the first of many battles for this incarnation of Suzaku, and while she was constantly in harm's way, her greatest fear was earning detention for being absent so many times.

Version 4.6.1
-------------
16 October 2018

 

 

== Design ==



= General =

- Well & Tarpit Attack Range increased from 800 to 900.
- Speed state from the well now dispels upon entering combat.
*A reminder that this mechanic only exists in Casual Mode.



= Heroes =

Bushwack

Jungle Toxin
- Bonus Attack Speed per charge reduced from 15/20/25 to 10/15/20.
*Max bonus Attack Speed from this ability reduced from 300/400/500 to 200/300/400.

+ Bushwack's win rate spiked up a bit too high since Patch 4.6.0's introduction, primarily due to the Boss changes. Reducing the effectiveness of Jungle Toxin for early-game ease of soloing Bosses (coupled with the other Boss adjustments in this patch) should put him in a relatively balanced spot.

_______________________________________________

Chipper

Rocket Barrage
- Magic Damage based on percentage of distanced traveled changed from 10% to 9/11/13/15%.
- Max Magic Damage increased from 200 to 200/220/240/260.

+ Leveling Rocket Barrage and landing rockets as you level up the skill did not feel rewarding enough, even though you obtain more charges of Rocket Barrage per level. These changes should greatly improve the feel of landing your rockets.

_______________________________________________

 

Glacius

Glacial Downpour
- Magic Damage per shard impact changed from 55/95/135 to 80/110/140.
- Max channel time increased from 4 seconds to 6 seconds.
- Radius of the overall shard distribution and slow aura increased from 635 to 700.
- Attack Speed Slow from the slow aura increased from 20 to 30.
- Cooldown reduced from 150/120/90 seconds to 120/105/90 seconds.

+ Glacius' Glacial Downpour offered too little incentive & had a poor risk-reward ratio to obtain at level 6, and was often skipped until level 10. The rewards of using the skill properly throughout the game now more appropriately correspond to the risk Glacius has to take (as a fragile support hero) to be in the middle of the fight.

+ The overall zone control effect of Glacial Downpour has also been increased by extending the potential max duration of the Glacial Downpour, which is often useful if Glacius can channel in fog of war.

+ The slight radius adjustment mean that the damage is slightly more widely distributed (and thus will hit a single target slightly less on average), which only slightly compensates for balancing out the skill's increase to its Magic Damage.

_______________________________________________

Ichor

Saint's Blood
- Max amount of extra Damage Reduction from Debuffs & Stuns is now capped at 50%.
*Max total Damage Reduction from Saint's Blood is now set to 60/65/70/75%.

+ With the game having an abundant number of Debuffs & Stuns being applied to Ichor, Ichor was literally invincible in certain scenarios.

+ A cap to this skill's effectiveness has been imposed to prevent these occurrences, though Ichor a max Damage Reduction of 75% is still incredibly high despite having a cap now.

_______________________________________________



 

= Items =

Bottle
- Health restored per sip increased from 125 to 135.
- Mana restored per sip reduced from 125 to 80.

+ The initial buff to Bottle was simply too much since patch 4.5.0 (even after the most recent adjustments in patch 4.5.1) to the point where sidelanes can pick up the item with little to no penalty as a reusable source of efficient Mana sustain.

+ As a result, Bottle's Mana sustain will be toned down significantly, but will still result in a small net buff compared to its original iteration. To compensate, the Health sustain was brought back to its original values.

_______________________________________________

Ophelia's Pact
- Cost reduced from 200 to 100.
- Stack requirement reduced from 6 to 5.

+ Gold is the most critical resource for support heroes early on, thus reducing the cost allows them to pick it up with less worry of getting a return on its investment.

_______________________________________________

 

= Forests of Caldavar =

Kongor & Hell Kongor

- Starting Health increased from 5000 to 6500.
- Starting Damage decreased from 80 to 60.
- Magic Armor reduced from 30 to 25.
- Killer gold bonus reduced from 350 to 300.
- Team gold bonus reduced from 200 to 150.

+ The Bosses were being killed too quickly too easily without much of a chance of counterplay early on, and was also a little too rewarding. Addressing these issues should make both Bosses less of a must-get and allows for a bit more flexibility in contesting Bosses early on.

_______________________________________________



General Map Changes

- Moved the top rune further away from mid.
*Now it is the same distance from the mid lane as the bottom rune is.

- Moved the previous ward spot near the top rune on the legion ramp (near mid) to be near the ramp in the river.
*This should allow this spot to be used to see the new top rune position.

- Added a new ward spot near the Legion Kongor area, below the Ancient Camp.
*This ward spot should help teams gain vision and push uphill in order to contest the Legion Kongor area.

- Added a new ward spot near the Hellbourne Kongor area on the ramp in the direction towards the T1 Hellbourne mid Tower.
- Added a new ward spot near the Hellbourne Kongor area on the ramp in the direction towards the T2 Hellbourne mid Tower.
*These 2 new ward spots should help both teams contest the Hellbourne Kongor.

- Moved the ward spot near the legion ancients next to the bottom rune to be higher up.
*This will allow this ward spot to see the bottom rune.

- Added more trees on both sides of the Legion bottom pull camp.
*This should prevent heroes from accidentally agroing the camp when simply walking by.

+ These are a round of changes aimed at making the new map more fair and Kongors more contestable by both attackers and defenders, as well as fixing minor issues.

_______________________________________________

 

= Mid Wars =

General
- The Well & Tarpit now have 3 attack structures once again.
- Base Hero Level reduced from 4 to 3.
- Passive Experience per Minute reduced from 200 to 120.
- Passive Gold per Minute reduced from 200 to 150.
- Starting Gold reduced from 1000 to 850.

 

Kongor
- Now invulnerable for the first 6 minutes of the game (like in Forests of Caldavar).
- Respawn time reduced from 6 minutes to 4 minutes.
- Stat buffs upon killing Kongor are no longer doubled when compared to Forests of Caldavar (i.e. they are the default values now).
- Now only drops 1 Token of Sight upon death (as opposed to 2).
- Initial Max Health increased from 2500 to 3500.
- Max Health gained per 30 seconds increased from 25 to 35.
- Siege bonus upon killing Kongor reduced from +80% to +40%.

+ In general, the pace of Mid Wars has been increased too greatly and has become too dependent on killing Kongor.

+ These changes address all of these issues and also lessen Kongor's snowball effect, but allows him to spawn a little more frequently at the same time.

 

Homecoming Stone
- Cooldown reduced from 65 seconds to 30 seconds (in this mode only).

+ This change allows heroes to travel back to their base more frequently to heal up, which promotes more action in the long run.

New Halloween Pearl Avatar: Pumpkin Party Pearl
- Pumpkins are the ultimate addition to any Halloween party. They can carry candy, hold candles, get carved into delightful Jack-O-Lanterns, and -- if Pumpkin Party Pearl is planning the event -- explode in a glorious shower of candy and holiday decorations. She is the most sought-after Halloween party planner across of Newerth, throwing epic events like Ophelia's infamous "Beauty and the Beast Halloween Bash" and Doctor Repulsor's "Opposites Attract Halloween Ball." When she isn't busy planning and executing one of these elite galas, she loves whirling through the countryside, popping into random gatherings and spreading her Halloween cheer to all.

 

New Halloween Lord Salforis Avatar: Lord Samhain
- All hail Lord Samhain, harvester of souls and god of Halloween! The villagers of Fuathmoor have respected -- and possibly worshiped -- this deity for centuries, and for all of that time he's been satisfied to rise from All Hells once a year on the final day of harvest and collect his share of victims. But now, with the raucous brats of Newerth taking over his holiday and using it as an excuse to gorge on endless candy, Lord Samhain has mustered all of his pagan power to emerge early and teach these revelers a lesson, for he'll not just be harvesting souls this year -- he's also really excited about those full-size candy bars and the peanut butter cups with chocolate candy in them.

New Goldenveil Avatar: Roninveil
- Roninveil was once a highly respected samurai for a powerful daimyo in the Sang-La Mountains, a feudal lord who was disgraced and sentenced to death by boiling when it was discovered he'd been secretly ordering the assassinations of his fellow lords in order to steal their land and treasure. Ashamed and without a master, Roninveil was preparing to commit seppuku in an attempt to retain a shred of honor for himself and his lord's house, but when he drew the short tanto blade to disembowel himself a small note fell to the mats he knelt upon. It was from his dead master, and simply read, "My accusers stole my life and honor -- I am not guilty."

Roninveil sheathed the tanto, for such a message from the dead required further exploration. The samurai cautiously and quietly investigated the matter and found his master had indeed been framed by the surviving lords, who had cleverly seized his daimyo's property and split it among themselves to cover their own thievery. Well, if they wanted to dabble in assassinations and greed, the veteran samurai mused, he would show them how it was done by a true master. And so Roninveil's war of vengeance began.

Version 4.6.0
-------------
26 September 2018

 

== Champions of Newerth: Season 8 ==

 

= Matchmaking =

- After 10 minutes, the matchmaking constraints will start to relax for solo queuers to find a game quicker.
- If you are in a game where you go up against a 4-queue or 5-queue, MMR loss for that game is 50% if you are a solo or duo.
*Specific conditions: applies to any combination of only 2-queues & solo-queues, and MMR is only reduced if playing vs. a 4-queue or 5-queue on the enemy team.

 

= Ranked Pick =

 

New Picking Mode: Ranked Pick

+ Ranked Pick is our new competitive picking mode. This mode allows everyone on your team to have an influence on Hero Bans and Hero Picks, and does not restrict that influence to the player with the highest Rank on your team. Because of its pick mode mechanics, Ranked Pick encourages teamwork and strategic drafting to maximize your team's synergy and counter the opponent's hero picks and strategies.

Banning Phase
- The game starts with 20 seconds for every player to vote for Blind Banning heroes.
*Each player only has 2 votes.
*A player may choose to make 0 votes or 1 vote if they wish.
*Players can only see their own votes.

- After all Blind Bans are made or until the timer expires, the game bans the top 4 heroes that have the most votes for being Blind Banned.
*No indication of how many votes were made for each hero are given to players.

- If 4 heroes with the most votes for being Blind Banned cannot be chosen because of ties, then the game chooses randomly between the ones that require a tiebreaker.
*e.g. There is a 3-2-2-1-1-1 distribution for Blind Ban votes. The game will select the 3-2-2 heroes and take one of the heroes with 1 Blind Ban randomly for the 4th hero.

Picking Phase
- A random team is chosen to pick first.
- Any player from the team can pick a hero for themselves. When the number of picks per team in a turn is done, it switches to the other team.
- The number of picks per team when alternating picking turns is: 1-2-2-2-2-1.
- Picking time per turn is 30 seconds. If the 30 seconds expires and picks are not fully used for that turn, the game will pick a random hero for the top-most player on that team for the remaining hero picks that turn, giving priority to players that have a hero shadowpicked.
- Once all players have picked their hero, a 20 second time period is provided for players to briefly discuss their general strategy and to swap heroes (if necessary).

 

=== Design ===

 

= Music =

- The music in the Hero Pick Phase has been changed to the Classic soundtrack (from HoN's initial release date)!
*HoN enthusiasts shall rejoice!



= New Feature: Consumables Slot =

- The Ward Slot has been replaced with 2x Consumable Slots!
*The default hotkey for the second Consumable Slot is Alt+F.

- These slots can only hold specific Consumable Items. Exact list:
*Ward of Sight
*Ward of Revelation
*Dust of Revelation
*Homecoming Stone
*Flying Courier (Spectral Owl for PBT)
*Veiled Rot

+ Players have been having a hard time carrying a lot of the necessary consumable items in the meta for quite a while now. This change aims to help every single player not worry as much about inventory space as the game progresses.

+ There is now no excuse for any player to not to carry a Homecoming Stone. Players should always have a Homecoming Stone in their inventory or consumable slot unless they have Post Haste as their choice of a Marchers upgrade.

+ This change is helpful for players who want to get their own utility consumables, reduce dependence on teammates & increase reliability of use (e.g. getting Dust of Revelation to counter stealthed heroes).

+ These changes were specifically targeted towards Support Heroes that have been having a hard time keeping their value up alongside the increasing amount of utility consumables they are expected to carry.

+ To all players who aren't playing a Support Hero, please help your Support Heroes out by taking some of their gold burden in the early/mid game so they can get items & have fun too!
*You would be surprised at how much difference a small/medium cost core item would make on a support hero rather than getting a minor upgrade on your own hero if you don't actually play Support Heroes that much.



= Learnatorium =

- Items and all of their details are finally available to view in the Learnatorium!
*The layout for these items is similar to browsing the item shop in an actual game.

 

= Other =

Single Draft
- Pick time reduced from 120 seconds to 40 seconds.

+ The picking phase for Single Draft in Mid Wars was too long, so the pick timer was reduced significantly to address that issue.

 

 

== Forests of Caldavar ==

 

+ Forests of Caldavar has received a complete overhaul.

 

- The entire map received new textures and visual updates!
- Legion and Hellbourne bases have been streamlined and had excess buildings removed, reducing the amount of congestion in fights within the bases.
- The World Tree and Sacrificial Shrine, along with their two Tier 4 towers, have been moved to a higher elevation level than the Barracks.
- The Legion Well and Hellbourne Tarpit have been moved to a higher elevation than the Main Base Structure, making fountain spawn camping even more difficult than before.
- Top and bottom lanes had their treelines revamped on the sides of the lane, allowing for more aggressive and sneaky plays for both teams.
- Top and bottom lanes now have an Easy pull camp for the Safe (commonly known as "short") Lane, and a Medium pull camp for the Unsafe (commonly known as the "long" or "off") Lane, allowing for increased contention and further diversifying lane dynamics.
*Heroes in their Safe Lane can pull their Easy camp at ~x:15/x:45.
*Heroes in their Safe Lane can pull the Medium camp at ~x:55.
*Heroes in their Unsafe Lane can pull the Medium camp at ~x:15 (if on Hellbourne) or ~x:19 (if on Legion).

- Efficient, yet obvious marked ward spots have been added! Players can choose to ward in these locations, but expect to be counterwarded much more frequently if you choose to do so.
*Moderately skilled players will counterward relentlessly, which means that higher skilled players will discover ward spots that avoid these commonly counterwarded locations.
*Improvise your warding game by dynamically changing your ward locations and finding new ones!

- The number of juke spots on the map has been increased overall, notably in the jungle areas and around the middle lane!
*This allows for a higher skill ceiling of plays around those areas, as it now becomes more probable to escape from a sticky situation if you are skillful enough at juking!

- Balance has been improved between the Legion and Hellbourne jungle.
- Both jungles have been modified to allow for better neutral camp clearing rotations throughout the game.
- An Ancient neutral camp has been added to the jungle, increasing the total number of camps from 5 to 6 in the actual jungle!
- Bosses now reside near the legacy Ancient neutral camp locations (more details below!)
*The legacy Ancient neutral camp is still there, it has been shifted appropriately with respect to the Boss locations.

 


= New Bosses: Kongor & Hell Kongor =

 

+ The new map has 2 main bosses instead of one. Kongor will be on the Legion's side of the map (East of the top Tier 2 tower), while Hell Kongor will be on Hellbourne's side of the map (to the west of the bottom Tier 2 tower). Killing either one of these bosses grants your team permanent buffs, while killing both Kongor and Hell Kongor within a short amount of time gives you extra Sieging power to destroy structures, allowing teams to have an easier time ending games more quickly.

 

Kongor & Hell Kongor

Health: 5000
Health Regeneration: 20
Mana: 2000
Mana Regen: 10
Attack Damage: 80
Armor: 3
Magic Armor: 30
Movement Speed: 270
Sight Range: 1400/1400

Attack Range 150 (Melee)
Base Attack Time 1.0
Gold: 350 to killer, 200 for rest of team
Experience: 1000
Respawn Time: 8 Minutes
*Invulnerable until after the 6-minute mark.

- Kongor & Hell Kongor gain 1 Damage, 50 Max Health, 0.1 Armor, and 1 bonus damage to his Slam every 30 seconds (stops gaining bonus stats after 60 minutes).


When killed:
- Grants players a choice between the following permanent bonuses upon defeating Kongor or Hell Kongor:
* +4 Strength, +2 Agility, +6 Intelligence.
* +4% to All Damage Dealt.
* +15 Movement Speed.

- Applies "Kongor Slayer" to all heroes on the killer's team for 3 minutes.
- Kongor Slayer: Restores 40% of Max Health and 20% of Max Mana over the first 10 seconds. If another Boss is slain, applies "Kongor Decimator" to self for 3 minutes.
- Kongor Decimator: Restores 80% of Max Health and 40% of Max Mana over the first 10 seconds. Grants +80% bonus Damage vs Structures.
- Healing effect ends early if you take damage from enemy players.

 


+ Abilities:

Ability 1: Boulder Toss
- Throws rock at target location (200 radius) that lands after 2 seconds. Deals [150 + 10% of target's Max Health] in Magic Damage and stuns for 2 seconds.
- Will randomly use this ability as long as he is fighting at least 1 enemy hero (20% chance every second).

Ability 2: Slam
- Slows the Movement Speed and Attack Speed of all nearby players. Only used when 3 or more units are in melee range of this unit.

Ability 3: Ancient Skin
- Passively grants 70% Debuff and Stun Reduction.

Ability 4: Fury 
- When below 25% of your Max Health, gain 20 Attack Damage and 120 Attack Speed.

 

= General =

- Melee and Ranged Barracks are no longer deniable.
*This has been a legacy mechanic that has practically no upside to it, so the deny mechanic no longer works on the Barracks.

- The following abilities no longer require the hero to face within 180 degrees of the target location before starting the ability cast:
*Deadwood's Rotten Grasp
*Gladiator's Pitfall
*Riftwalker's Cascade Event

+ If not being cast in fog of war or chained after a crowd control effect, casting these abilities when the opponent is remotely paying any type of attention to you results in the target location of these abilities being highly telegraphed, allowing competent opponents to easily avoid these abilities with a 100% success rate by walking perpendicular to line in which these heroes are facing when finishing these ability casts.

+ By removing the turn requirement, it allows for proper mindgames (i.e. not a 100% dodge chance) between the ability caster & their opponents, as well as having these abilities be cast slightly faster in certain situations.





= Heroes =

 

Apex

Decimate
- Mana cost increased from 60/75/90/105 to 75/90/105/120.
- Cooldown increased from 10 to 12 seconds.

Fire Surge
- Mana cost increased from 80 to 70/80/90/100.

+ Apex has been performing very well for a while and has remained at the top spot despite more counters being introduced (like the buff to Spell Sunder and the Riftshards rework). Therefore, it is time to tone him down a bit.

_______________________________________________

Armadon

Armordillo
- Now also reduces damage taken from towers.

+ Reverting an old change to again allow Armadon to tank towers as a valid strategy.

_______________________________________________

Artillery

Homing Missile
- Added a new Staff of the Master effect: Reduces the cooldown by 20 seconds and increases cast range by 500. Changes the ability to target an area (300 radius). Shoots up to 2 missiles at enemies in the target area. Prioritises heroes and enemies closest to the center of the target location.

_______________________________________________

Behemoth

Fissure
- Can now activate the ability a 2nd time to shatter the rocks.

Shockwave
- Base Superior Magic Damage increased from 100/120/140 to 200/275/350.
- Non-hero Shockwave Magic Damage decreased from 30/40/50 to 25/35/45.
- Hero Shockwave Magic Damage decreased from 45/60/75 to 25/35/45.

+ Behemoth's Shockwave damage varied too greatly depending on the number of enemy units around when the damage only got increased by nearby enemy heroes.

+ Reverting it to its legacy form should normalize the damage a little bit more while simultaneously punishing push lineups harder.

_______________________________________________ 

Chipper

- Movement Speed increased from 295 to 315.
- Attack Range increased from 550 to 650.
- Strength reduced from 19 to 18.
- Strength gain per level reduced from 1.6 to 1.4.
- Agility reduced from 20 to 13.
- Agility gain per level reduced from 1.5 to 1.
- Intelligence gain per level increased from 3 to 3.2.
- Base Damage reduced from 20-27 to 18-23.
*Starting Damage reduced from 45-52 to 43-48.
- Base Armor increased from -0.5 to -0.42.
*Starting Armor reduced from 2.3 to 1.4.

Rocket Barrage
- Magic Damage changed from a static 90/105/120/135 to [40 + 10% of the Distance travelled by the rocket, up to a max of 200 Magic Damage].
- No longer deals 15/20/25/30 Magic Damage per second to enemies covered by Tar Toss.
- Charge refresh time increased from 3 to 4 seconds.
- Rocket speed increased from 1000 to 1200.
- Rocket touch radius increased from 70 to 75.
- Rockets can now hit neutral creeps.

Tar Toss
- Radius reduced from 300 to 250.
- Cast Range increased from 700 to 1500.
- Projectile travel time increased from 0.75 seconds to 1 second.

Sawblade Showdown
- Cast Range increased from 700 to 1200.

+ This rework turns Chipper into a very squishy but very dangerous long-range fighter. His abilities have received a lot of extra range but his survivability significantly went down. The reason Chipper was reworked was because we have a lot of general overlap between heroes that "just deal a lot of magic damage". Bombardier, Kinesis, Thunderbringer, Artesia to name a few. These changes help separate Chipper from the rest by giving him a magic-centric long-range niche.

_______________________________________________

Devourer

Guttling Hook
- Staff of the Master only: Cooldown increased from 6 seconds to 10 seconds.

+ Staff of the Master's bonus 500 range to Guttling Hook is already an amazing benefit. The cooldown reduction on the ability was overtuned and was causing Devourer's Guttling Hook to be too low risk. The cooldown was increased to 10 seconds, and is still an improvement to the base cooldown of 14 seconds for this ability when not boosted by Staff of the Master.

_______________________________________________

Doctor Repulsor

- Agility gain per level reduced from 1.8 to 1.5.

+ While Doctor Repulsor is in a good spot in the NAEU region, he is over-performing hard in the SEA region and is one of the top winners that's causing a lot of frustration. Adjusting the agility gain should hit his carry potential a little.

_______________________________________________

Drunken Master

Magic Brew (Reworked)
- Passive ability: whenever Drunken Master deals non-DoT damage to an enemy hero, he receives a buff for 5 seconds. This buff grants him 20/30/40/50% Debuff Duration reduction, 10/15/20/25 Health Regeneration, and 20/30/40/50 Movement Speed.
- Dealing damage again refreshes the duration of the buff.

+ Having a single-target spell negation effect on a skill at level 1 was too powerful, regardless of the cooldown values (while remaining within reason), as it heavily mitigated ganking attempts against Drunken Master in the laning phase, while simultaneously adding too much anti-peel while Drunken Master is comboing his skills onto a target.
+ As a result, Magic Brew was reworked to remove the immense power imbalance early game, while adding a more tangible benefit later in the game and simultaneously mitigating frustration factors when playing against him.

_______________________________________________

Engineer

Steam Turret
- Turret now only deals 40/60/80/100% of damage to Melee heroes.
- Default Cooldown increased from 10 seconds to 12 seconds.
- Cooldown when Steam Turret is damaged increased from 5 seconds to 6 seconds.
- Turret can no longer be denied while the ability is on cooldown.

+ Engineer's Steam Turret comes online slightly too fast if you kill it shortly after it spawns. It can also feel downright unfair when going up against as a Melee hero. These changes rectify that problem.

_______________________________________________

Flint Beastwood

Explosive Flare
- Range increased from 900 to 1000.
- Cooldown reduced from 14 seconds to 10 seconds.

Deadeye
- Bonus Attack Range & Vision reduced from 100/200/300/400 to 85/165/245/325.
*Total Attack Range reduced from 700/800/900/1000 to 685/765/845/925.

Money Shot
- Magic Damage changed from 355/505/655 to 350/525/700.
- Range increased from 2000/2250/2500 to 2000/2500/3000.
- Break distance for the channel increased from 2300/2550/2800 to 3000/3500/4000.

+ 1000 Attack Range was a little too much even for Flint Beastwood, as the core frustration factor is not being able to quickly navigate to his position when he is attacking you & your camera is placed in a way where Flint Beastwood is well outside the center of your camera. 925 Attack Range is a more reasonable range for this

+ Flint Beastwood's overall win rate for all brackets is fine however, and some buffs were given to him in other areas to compensate for this.

+ Explosive Flare's cast range was less than Flint Beastwood's Attack Range, so it has been slightly increased past your max Attack Range to allow for better ease of use.

_______________________________________________

Forsaken Archer

Piercing Arrows
- Cast Range increased from 625 to 1475.

+ This change serves purely as a quality-of-life change, as the Cast Range was changed to match the maximum effective range of the arrows that are shot.

_______________________________________________

Goldenveil

Recluse
- If Goldenveil is Sighted, the Health Regeneration effects will still take place as long as there are no enemy player-controlled non-gadget units or enemy lane creeps within 2000 units.
*Intention is to prevent enemy Wards from dispelling the effect & preventing Goldenveil from being a "free" ward detector.

Greedgutter
- Gold bonus per token for yourself increased from 60/90/120 to 70/95/120.
- Gold bonus per token for each of your other teammates increased from 10/15/20 to 20/30/40.
- Base Magic Damage increased from 120/180/240 to 180/240/300. 

+ Goldenveil's ability to essentially be a mobile ward detector has been shown to be too frustrating after players started to abuse this strength of his, limiting the usefulness of Support Heroes overall (a class of heroes we want to encourage more players to play). These changes were made to remedy these frustration factors.

+ Goldenveil's primary intentional niche is to give his teammates more Gold when he participates in killing separate & "fresh" (high Golden Token count) targets on the opposing team, and this part of his kit has been accentuated for this purpose.

+ The Magic Damage on Greedgutter has been slightly increased to improve the general feel of Goldenveil's ultimate skill.

_______________________________________________

Ichor

- Starting intelligence reduced from 24 to 20.

+ Ichor has been performing very well after his recent Transfusion changes. A bit too well. His unusually high starting stats are a good place to adjust.

_______________________________________________

Kinesis

Thoughtsteal
- Cast Range reduced from 1000 to 800.

+ Originally, Thoughtsteal was designed to have an above-average cast range so that Kinesis can steal spells without endangering himself, as the spell on its own had no auxiliary effect before actually stealing the spell. After it got changed to have a reliable 2 second Silence, a Cast Range of 1000 is considered too high, so the Cast Range had to be reduced to account for this.

_______________________________________________

Magebane

- Starting Agility increased from 22 to 35.
- Base Damage lowered from 24-28 to 13-17.
*As a result, starting Damage increased from 46-50 to 48-52.
- Base Armor lowered from -1.08 to -3.1.
*As a result, starting Armor lowered from 2 to 1.8.
- Agility gain per level increased from 3.5 to 4.0.

+ We've had time to observe the effects of BAT normalization on Magebane and now it's time to bring his attack speed back up. We're keeping the BAT normalization changes as they streamline a stat that is usually very hidden. However, to mimic the effects that a low BAT had on Magebane, we are now giving him a lot of extra agility and making an abnormally high amount of agility a visible and unique aspect of the hero.

_______________________________________________

Midas

Elemental Warp
- Staff of the Master: Cast range bonus reduced from 700 to 500.

+ The range from which Midas can initiate can sometimes feel unfair and frustrating, especially since the addition of the new Jade Spire.

_______________________________________________

Monarch

Chrysalis
- Can now be activated again to end the effect early.

+ A quality of life change that gives Monarch more strategic options, increases her skill ceiling and reduces frustration in one swoop.

_______________________________________________

Nymphora

- Movement Speed increased from 295 to 300.
- Attack Range increased from 550 to 600.
- Starting Strength reduced from 19 to 16.
- Agility gain per level reduced from 1.6 to 1.2.
- Starting Intelligence increased from 27 to 28.
- Base Damage reduced from 20-27 to 15-22.
*Starting Damage reduced from 47-54 to 43-50.
- Base Armor reduced from 0.48 to -1.02.
*Starting Armor reduced from 3 to 1.5.

Volatile Pod
- Reworked.
- Target a position to place a Volatile Pod there that grows for 3 seconds.
- Builds up 50/70/90/110 Magic Damage and Healing per second while growing. The Volatile Pod explodes after it finishes growing, dealing the built-up Magic Damage to enemies and built-up Healing to allies.
- Can reactivate to explode the Volatile Pod early.
*Range: 800
*Radius: 500
*Mana Cost: 150/160/170/180
*Cooldown: 14 seconds

Nymphora's Zeal
- Moved to the Ability 2 (W) slot.
- Cooldown increased from 13 seconds to 16 seconds.
- Projectile speed increased from 1000 to 1300.
- Touch radius increased from 96 to 120.
- Range increased from 900 to 950.
- Magic Damage increased from 50/85/120/155 to 50/90/130/170.
- Stun duration reduced from 0.9/1.1/1.3/1.5 seconds to 1 second.

Grace of the Nymph
- Moved to the Ability 3 (E) slot.
- Cast time removed. Can now be cast while moving and without interruption.
- Mana cost reduced from 60 to 10/20/30/40.
- Cooldown reduced from 22/20/18/16 seconds to 18/16/14/12 seconds.
- Duration reduced from 4 to 3 seconds.
- Movement Speed bonus increased from 25/50/75/100 to 100.
- Total amount of mana restored reduced from 125/200/275/350 to 75/150/225/300.
- Now only the Movement Speed bonus expires when taking damage from enemy players.
*Mana regeneration stays even after taking damage from enemy players.

+ Nymphora's rework gives her a more interesting Volatile Pod and general quality of life improvements.

_______________________________________________

Pearl

Bubble Pop
- Healing reduced from 75/125/175/225 to 50/100/150/200.
- Radius reduced from 600 to 400.
- Now also deals 50/100/150/200 Magic Damage to enemies within the target area upon arrival.

Preservation
- Now reduces damage both on the inside and the outside of the bubble, as long as enemies are on the other side.
*For example, if you are inside the bubble and the enemy is outside the bubble, damage is reduced, same as before. But, if you are outside the bubble and the enemy is inside the bubble, damage is now also reduced.
- No longer grants bonus health regeneration to allies inside the bubble.
- Now instantly heals allies inside the bubble for 150/250/350 Health upon use.

+ We've received a lot of feedback that Pearl's ultimate felt underwhelming so we're improving it! We didn't want to just increase the damage reduction since that begins to intrude on the niches of Rhapsody and Jeraziah. Instead we've now made it work both ways. This makes the ability much more dangerous for enemies as it remains useful even when enemies step inside it. It creates a "shield dance"-like effect where heroes will try to abuse the edge of the bubble to gain the damage reduction at all times. We're also removing the health regeneration and replacing it with a heal to make the ability feel more impactful and not punish players for leaving the circle.

+ Bubble Pop is being changed to allow for more offensive uses where the heal would normally be completely wasted. This creates a choice of assisting teammates and following up with Preservation or engaging on enemies to try get them out of position with Whirlbubble.

_______________________________________________

Pestilence

Ability 1: Flight (Reworked)
- Activate to apply 15/30/45/60% Movement Speed and unitwalking to self but increase damage taken by 15% for 7 seconds.
*Cooldown: 10 seconds
*Mana Cost: 0
- Ability can be activated again for 25 Mana to fly to a target location, once. This goes on a 3 second cooldown when receiving damage from a player-controlled source.
*450/700/950/1200 Cast Range, 1000 projectile speed.
- The full cooldown of the ability starts after the Movement Speed bonus state expires.

+ These changes give the ability more flavour (letting Pestilence actually fly) and counter-play (bringing back the damage taken increase, as well as putting a Portal Key-like cooldown on the jump).

_______________________________________________

Puppet Master

Whiplash
- Amount of time to automatically lose a charge when not attacking reduced from 12/10/8/6 to 4 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Shellshock

Fireflies
- Magic Damage increased from 80/120/160/200 to 100/150/200/250.
- Mana Cost increased from 50/60/70/80 to 60/70/80/90.

Rolling Thunder
- Added a new Staff of the Master effect: Increases ball speed by 50% (from 600-900 to 900-1350), cast range by 700 and Magic Damage by 70. Allows you to cancel the roll by activating the ability again.

+ Making Fireflies feel more impactful and giving Shellshock a much desired ability to stop his charge... at a cost.

_______________________________________________

Soul Reaper

Withering Presence
- Added a new active effect: Doubles the health loss effects of the aura but halves its range for the next 10 seconds.
*Cooldown: 20 seconds.
*Mana Cost: 0.
*During the effect health loss is increased from 0.4/0.6/0.8/1% to 0.8/1.2/1.6/2% of Max Health per second and aura range is decreased from 800/900/1000/1100 to 400/450/500/550.

Inhuman Nature
- Now collects charges from any units within 1000 range that were killed by an ally player controlled unit.
*This means that ally heroes scoring last hits will now also net you charges.
- Charges gained from enemy hero kills are no longer doubled.
- Mana restored per charge lowered from 12/24/36/48 to 10/20/30/40.

+ Withering Presence can feel underwhelming despite racking up respectable amounts of damage because the effect is so spread out. We're giving players the ability to focus it for a duration for more impact.

+ Changes to Inhuman Nature allow Soul Reaper to be played more in a role of a support and to work better with his teammates during pushes.

_______________________________________________

Wildsoul

Summon Booboo
- Added a new Staff of the Master effect: Booboo can now deal damage, attack and use Swipe even when far from Wildsoul, but his attack speed is cut in half during that time.

+ Time to bring back Mock Wildsoul builds, especially since Mock is getting some love!

_______________________________________________



= Items =

 

New Protective item: Armor of the Mad Mage

- Recipe: Acolyte's Staff (2600) + Platemail (1400) + Recipe (200) = 4200 Gold Total
- Passively grants: +25 Intelligence, +10 Armor.
- Aura (900 radius): Reduces the Magic Armor of nearby enemies by 4.
- Active: Upon use grants self 60 Armor that tapers off over 6 seconds.
*Mana Cost: 75
*Cooldown: 45 seconds.
- This item contains an Activation Modifier. Using this item disables other items with this modifier for the duration.

+ This item aims to fill the void left by the removal of bonus Spell Damage from Grimoire of Power, and gives casters an extra option to go toe-to-toe against carries.

 

New Supplies Item: Ophelia's Pact

- Costs 200 gold. Can only be purchased once per player per game.
- Upon being purchased it is instantly consumed and creates a one-time passive quest for the player with the following objectives: Stack 6 neutral camps, place 3 Wards of Sight, counter a Ward of Sight once.
- Upon completion of the quest the player is offered 3 choices (and can only pick one) as a reward: +20 Attack Damage / +700 Gold / +6 to Strength, Agility and Intelligence.

+ This is a new support-focused item that introduces a new quest mechanic to the game! Once purchased (no matter where, no matter how), your hero will gain a quest state that you can look at to track your progress at any time. Completed objectives will turn green.

+ Ophelia wants you to help her take care of the jungle, and she pays handsomely.

_______________________________________________

Barrier Idol
- Debuff and Stun Duration Reduction lowered from 30% to 20%.

Shaman's Headdress
- Debuff and Stun Duration Reduction lowered from 15% to 10%.

+ The Debuff & Stun Duration Reduction was infringing a little too much with Berzerker's niche, but was still a nice little bonus for the heroes that pick these items up. Thus, the effectiveness of these traits were slightly reduced.

_______________________________________________

Flying Courier
- Cost reduced from 250 Gold to 200 Gold.

Grave Locket
- Now also gives the owner 50 experience whenever you stack a camp.
- Synchronization state now also grants your partner the bonus gold and experience if the kill was made by one of your units instead of your hero.

Orb of Zamos
- Recipe Cost reduced from 250 Gold to 200 Gold.
*Total cost reduced from 350 Gold to 300 Gold.
- Synchronization state now also grants your partner the bonus gold if the kill was made by one of your units instead of your hero.

+ These cost reductions were made as quality-of-life changes for Support Heroes.

+ Synchronization changes allow heroes who control multiple units to fully benefit from the item.

_______________________________________________

Ghost Marchers
- Buff Duration reduced from 6 seconds to 3 seconds.
- Buff Movement Speed bonus increased from 10% to 20%.
- Cooldown reduced from 12 seconds to 10 seconds.

+ Ghost Marchers' properties were ported from PBT, allowing it to grant your hero a large burst of Movement Speed (instead of a small burst of Movement Speed over a longer period of time).

_______________________________________________

Lex Talionis
- Armor aura now also works on ally buildings.

_______________________________________________

Mock of Brilliance
- Attack Damage increased from 65 to 75.
- Magic Damage per second from the aura increased from 40 to 60.

+ Mock of Brilliance has fallen off significantly once the meta-game shifted to a predominantly ganking one (and less so a farming one).

+ Historically, it was known as a high-risk, high-reward item if you were able to farm it within a reasonable amount of time. Increasing the rewards to be more suitable to the risk level of picking it up should make it more feasible in today's meta.

_______________________________________________

Plated Greaves
- Armor per charge lowered from 2 to 1.
- Maximum number of charges increased from 4 to 8.

+ Plated Greaves was achieving its fullest Armor value too quickly. Changing the Armor mechanics makes it a better item against multiple autoattackers or high Attack Speed heroes.

_______________________________________________

Sand Scepter
- Recipe cost increased from 500 Gold to 600 Gold.
*Total cost increased from 2000 Gold to 2100 Gold.

+ Ever since Sand Scepter's buff to ally heroes (alongside the general buffs for Support Heroes), it has taken off in popularity and effectiveness.

+ Slightly increasing the cost of this item is a suitable slight nerf for this item at this time, as we still want it to be affordable for the heroes who pick it up.

_______________________________________________

Twin Blades
- Recipe Cost reduced from 500 Gold to 325 Gold.
*Total cost reduced from 3275 Gold to 3100 Gold.

+ Twin Blades became slightly too expensive for what it did after the initial recipe cost nerf, so the change was toned back a bit.

_______________________________________________

Void Talisman
- Magic Armor reduction on self lowered from 5.5 to 5.
- Recipe Cost increased from 800 Gold to 960 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 1340 Gold to 1500 Gold.

+ Void Talisman is slightly too powerful now that support heroes have generally received some help in obtaining Gold. As a result, the recipe cost has been slightly increased. The small increase ensures that support heroes will still feasibly pick this item up if they need it in their games.

+ The Magic Armor reduction on self has been adjusted so that it is the same as each hero's base Magic Armor.

_______________________________________________

Wingbow
- Melee Movement Speed bonus increased from 10 to 20.

+ Bonuses for Melee Heroes who pick up this item were lacking. A 10 Movement Speed bonus may seem underwhelming on paper, but it will have a pretty big impact in-game due to the limited ways & item slots heroes have to increase their Movement Speed.

_______________________________________________

 

 

== Mid Wars ==



+ Mid Wars has received a complete overhaul.

- The entire map received new textures and visual updates!
- A new Mid Wars map has been created with the intent of maintaining action throughout the entire game. The overall map has been made smaller to accomplish this, with additional neutral camps added as additional sources of gold.
- Kongor has also been added to replace Transmutanstein & Zorgath with toned down stats, allowing it to be killed earlier in the game and increasing the importance of this point of contention.
- The side areas of the map have more trees, creating an environment with additional juke spots and fog of war.

 

= Mechanical Changes for Mid Wars =

General
- Base Hero Level increased from 3 to 4.
- Passive Experience per Minute increased from 120 to 200.
- Passive Gold per Minute increased from 150 to 200.
- Starting Gold increased from 850 to 1000.
- Respawn time increased from (0.6 * Hero Level) to (0.75 * Hero Level).
- A Homecoming Stone is now added to your inventory at the start of the game. Homecoming Stones have infinite uses in this mode.

 

Well
- Heroes now gain 150 Movement Speed from their ally Well. This buff lasts 6 seconds, or after they are farther than 4000 units away from their ally Well.
- Max Health percentage heal per second increased from 10% to 15%.
- Static Mana Regeneration per second increased from 7 to 10.

Bosses
- Max Health reduced from 5000 to 2500.
- Max Health per 30 seconds reduced from 50 to 25.
- Stat buffs upon killing Kongor from Forests of Caldavar are doubled.
- Siege bonus is given when killing Kongor in this map.
- Respawn time decreased from 10 minutes to 6 minutes.
- Now drops 2 Tokens of Sight.

 

= Mid Wars Balance =

+ Certain heroes have been top tier in more serious Mid Wars game in the entirety of HoN's history. Altering numbers in skills (e.g. damage, disable duration, etc.) is not the correct approach, so more drastic stat adjustments will take place to make them more bearable to play against, as well as increase the general hero diversity in this mode.



Artillery
- Base Strength reduced from 18 to 15.
- Strength gain per level reduced from 2.0 to 1.2.

Devourer
- Base Agility reduced from 14 to 12.
- Agility per level reduced from 1.5 to 1.1.

Flint Beastwood
- Base Strength reduced from 18 to 15.
- Strength gain per level reduced from 1.7 to 1.2.

Flux
- Base Agility reduced from 21 to 18.

New Kraken Avatar: Killer Kraken
- Captured by whalers in the Boreal Sea and sold into captivity at the Adkarna Zoo, this magnificent beast refused to learn any tricks or obey the commands of his keepers, no matter how many fish they dangled in front of his nose. But he did eat the fish, and every night when the park closed he spent the dark hours swimming laps, climbing the slippery rock walls above his enclosure, and running the tiers of bleachers created for the mindless gawkers. He knew the polished facade of the zoo was a thin veneer over what the place truly was -- a maximum security prison built to keep the attractions locked down until their usefulness was at an end. During his nightly excursions he visited the other enclosures, whispering to the prisoners to share his plans, and to prove to them it was possible to escape their tiny worlds.

When the time was right, midday on one of the busiest days at the zoo, Killer Kraken burst from his enclosure and rampaged through the park, targeting his so-called trainers and causing all-out panic among the crowds as he opened every enclosure before leaping from the zoo wall into the Inner Sea. That is the last anyone saw of him, though they fear he's plotting even more mayhem and vengeance upon those who dared to imprison him.

= Little Red Riding Hood =

New Little Red Riding Hood Aluna Avatar: Aluna Red Riding Hood

New Little Red Riding Hood Master of Arms Avatar: Big Bad MoA
- Her poor old grandmother warned Aluna Red Riding Hood to stay on the path as she traveled through the Forests of Caldavar for a visit, but the precocious young woman didn't listen. Distracted by the beautiful flowers and soothing burble of a cool river, she wandered into the dark woods and was met by a lone mercenary taking a respite from the war between the Legion and Hellbourne. The soldier was instantly smitten by her beauty and pure soul, and he made it his mission to win her heart by any means necessary. When she told him she couldn't linger because she was on her way to visit her sickly grandmother, he suggested she pick some of the lovely wildflowers nearby -- those would certainly cheer up old granny, right? The girl agreed, and while she was collecting blossoms the Big Baddie rushed to her grandmothers house and leveled it with concussion grenades and fully automatic fire.

There, he thought. No granny, no visit! Free of that distraction, he changed into his best non-bloodstained suit and replaced his arsenal with bouquets and jewelry that would make Aluna Red Riding Hood forget all about her recently deceased grandmother and fall completely in love with him. Let the hunt begin!

 

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==



= General =

- Entering the Mid Wars lobby with the Hero Ban pick mode will now play the correct announcer voice clips.

 

= Heroes =

Calamity
- Dragon's Path no longer sends the rotating dragons to abnormally far distances when Jade Spire is in your inventory.
*Note that due to how the ability functions, it is intended that Jade Spire does not actually change the rotation distances of the dragons for this ability.
- Rift Calamity no longer causes frame drops when using her abilities.

Doctor Repulsor
- Ludicrous Speed sound effects no longer persist if Doctor Repulsor exits fog.
- Punk Doctor Repulsor now plays the correct sounds when he uses Ludicrous Speed.

Electrician
- Fixed Static Grip's tether break range when Jade Spire is in your inventory.

Empath
- Essence Link no longer immediately snaps when being cast while As One is active.
*Using Essence Link and then using As One will still snap the Essence Link. This is intended.

Engineer
- Voltstone now plays its proper visual effects when procced from the Steam Turret's attacks.

Gauntlet
- Grapple now functions properly when Jade Spire is in your inventory.

Ichor
- Damage credit is now also properly sourced from Ichor when you initially transfer a damage-over-time debuff to an enemy unit.

Nitro
- Bosozoku Nitro no longer briefly leaves a teapot at her location when using Divide & Conquer.

Parallax
- The leash ranges for Fulcrum Shift and Ionic Dash have been refactored to account for changes in cast range (e.g. from Jade Spire).

Rally
- Seismic Slam's affector will no longer persist after the initial shockwave.
- Seismic Slam now properly has its range & radius boosted by Jade Spire if Staff of the Master is boosting the skill.

Rampage
- Stampede now Perplexes Rampage for a duration equal to Stampede's cast action time (250ms) when Stampede starts its earliest cast point.
*Prevents more Stampede exploits with item-queuing.

Tarot
- Bound by Fate now properly reveals the primary target if it is not bound to a secondary target.
- Bound by Fate's snap mechanic now functions properly if you bind a main target to an illusion & the illusion dies.

Tempest
- Icons for Meteor and Elemental Void have been reverted to their original ones (instead of using their PBT icons).

Thunderbringer
- Lightning Storm now deals the appropriate amount of damage respective to its level (rather than always dealing damage equal to values shown for Level 1 of the ability regardless of the actual current level of the ability).

Tremble
- Fixed Hive Mind refreshing its cooldown after finishing sometimes.
- Terror Port can no longer be used to tunnel to a Terror Mound that is too close to the enemy base.
*Radius is 3700 units from the enemy well.
*Done to prevent a large extent of "easy" backdooring potential with this skill.

 

Warchief
- Fixed the cooldown reduction mathematical algorithm so that it reduces the cooldown at the correct intervals if the initial cooldown of a skill is between (but excluding the end bounds of) 3 seconds to 6 seconds.

 

= Items =

- Flying Courier can now use Restoration Stone to refresh its own items and abilities.
*This no longer contains the exploit of being able to refresh the abilities of your main hero if Restoration Stone is used while on the Flying Courier or another one of your units.

Jade Spire
- No longer increases the range of Arachna's Webbed Shot and Vindicator's Master's Incantation if they are manually cast.
- Now explicitly mentions specific skills it intentionally does not affect (when it is believed to affect them outside the conventional & intuitive rules). Jade Spire intentionally does not boost the cast range of the following skills:
*Adrenaline's Rush
*Bushwack's Side Step
*Drunken Master's Lunge





Version 4.5.5
-------------
4 September 2018

 

 

== Design ==

 

 

= General =

Concede Votes

- Concede vote call cooldown (for a particular player) increased from 2 minutes to 3 minutes.
+ Although we want the majority of the players on a particular team to be able to decide when they want to concede after 15 minutes, some players were repeating their concede vote calling too frequently, which may eventually aggravate the team enough to pass the vote out of frustration. The increased concede vote cooldown aims to ease this frustration factor.

- Methodology for the 30 minute mark changed slightly: now rounds up to the nearest integer of 70% of the remaining players left on your team to determine the concede vote threshold.
- The following scenarios now occur when looking at the number of players left on your team:
*5 players: Concede threshold after 30 minutes requires 3 players (unchanged from before)
*4 players: Concede threshold after 30 minutes requires 3 players (instead of 2 players)
*3 players: Concede threshold after 30 minutes requires 2 players (instead of 1 player)
*2 or less players: Concede threshold after 30 minutes requires 1 player

+ The 30-minute concede threshold for 3 players was never meant to skew the vote requirements towards the minority for teams that have 4 or 3 players remaining. These changes simply remedy that issue.

 

= Base Attack Time Changes for Heroes =

+ Certain heroes had Base Attack Time values other than 1.7, which allowed them to scale better or worse than every other hero (lower values mean they scale better with Attack Speed). Changing them all to be the baseline value of 1.7 will maintain consistency on Attack Speed scaling for all heroes. Balance on the following heroes can be adjusted in the future if required.
*Exception: Pebbles with skill points placed in his Enlarge skill will still increase his Base Attack Time, as he gains a substantial amount of Attack Damage in return.

Aluna
- Base Attack Time increased from 1.55 to 1.7.

Draconis
- Base Attack Time decreased from 2 to 1.7.

Grinex
- Base Attack Time increased from 1.5 to 1.7.

Magebane
- Base Attack Time increased from 1.45 to 1.7.

Prisoner
- Base Attack Time decreased from 1.9 to 1.7.

Revenant
- Base Attack Time increased from 1.5 to 1.7.

_______________________________________________





= Heroes =

 

Defiler

Wave of Death
- Magic Damage increased from 100/175/250/300 to 100/175/250/325.

+ Defiler is currently underperforming. This seemed like a good opportunity to fix the first ability's levelling inconsistency while providing a power boost.

_______________________________________________

Doctor Repulsor

Ludicrous Speed
- Damage per 100 distance travelled decreased from 15/20/25 to 10/15/20.
*Maximum Damage decreased from 300/400/500 to 200/300/400.

+ Doctor Repulsor has received some indirect buffs through the recent changes to Hellflower and Null Stone. Combined with his previous buff this has pushed him a bit over the top, so he is being toned back down accordingly.

_______________________________________________

Glacius

Ice Imprisonment
- Can no longer be used on allies or self.

Glacial Downpour
- Staff of the Master only: Now reduces damage taken by 50% instead of applying Ice Imprisonment to self for the duration of the channel.
*This keeps the ability almost exactly the same without it having to rely on Ice Imprisonment.

+ The vast majority of the time Ice Imprisonment's secondary "ally" effect goes off, it is not to protect an ally but an accidental mistake. 99% of the secondary effect uses result in frustration. Furthermore, the ability to immobilize and protect an ally already exists in a much better and direct (and actually used) way on another hero - Monarch.
+ Changes to the Staff effect leave the ability in almost the same state, with the added counter-play of now being able to cancel the ultimate with a Tablet of Command and the added ability for Glacius to use Assassin's Shroud during the channel after acquiring Staff.

_______________________________________________

 

Mimix

 

Echo Strikes
- Now grants a maximum of 300 Attack Speed.

_______________________________________________

Tarot

Bound by Fate
- Now Reveals affected targets.
- Duration increased from 5 seconds to 6 seconds.

+ Tarot used to be able to do well against heroes with Stealth in lane via her old Far Scry ability. However, she also had 3 point-and-click abilities, making this hero be tedious to play. Finally, the old Far Scry secondary target functionality was rather unintuitive, forcing Tarot to attack another target to maximize her overall damage output instead of focusing her main target directly upon marking them.
+ Rather than reverting Far Scry back to how it was before, Bound by Fate gains the strong utility against stealthed heroes from the old Far Scry ability.

_______________________________________________

Tempest

Meteor
- Range decreased from 1500 to 600/900/1200/1500.
- Impact delay increased from 1 second to 1.2 seconds.

+ Meteor has been exceeding expectations on its efficacy of giving Tempest players an option to make Portal Key a non-mandatory item pickup.
+ It was performing a little too well (particularly in the early game), so its power has been toned down to let the Tempest make wiser choices in their early game skill build.

_______________________________________________

Tundra

Call of Winter
- Shiver now gains invulnerability for 3 seconds upon respawning.
- Shiver now has a new subability, Return: instantly teleports Shiver back to Tundra if Shiver has not received any damage within the last 3 seconds.
*60 second cooldown.

+ These changes solve some frustration factors on Tundra's side regarding Shiver's general usability, and double up as quality-of-life changes.

_______________________________________________

War Beast

Summon Hellhounds
- Hellhound Damage increased from 15/25/35/45 to 25/35/45/55.

+ Recent changes to War Beast's first ability aimed to be a nerf, compensated with the new ability to keep Hellhounds around forever. It seems as though permanent Hellhounds did not add as much power as we had anticipated, and combined with the recent item and gameplay changes have left War Beast in a weaker state.

_______________________________________________

Wildsoul

- Starting Strength reduced from 17 to 15.
- Strength gain per level increased from 2.1 to 2.2.

Booboo

Alpha Male
- Changed from giving bonus damage vs non-hero units to giving bonus damage vs jungle creeps.
*This includes Ancients.

Swipe
- Physical Damage reduced from 175 to 150.

+ While Wildsoul's power level is adequate in the jungle, he performs incredibly well (too well, even) when played in the lane in the role of a more traditional carry. He should still be performing very well in lane after these changes, so we look forward to players figuring him out.

_______________________________________________




= Items =

 

Jade Spire (Reworked)
- Recipe: Pickled Brain (950) + Manatube (850) + Recipe (700) = 2500 Gold Total
- Grants: +250 Max Mana, +100% Mana Regeneration
- Increases the Cast Range of your Abilities & Items by 250. This effect does not stack.

+ Jade Spire is now an item that increases your Ability & Item Cast Ranges. This item is particularly useful for high impact spellcasters!

 

Barbed Armor
- Visual glow colour on its active effects has been changed from yellow to red to differentiate it from the Shrunken Head visuals.
- Activation sound has been updated to be more prominent.

+ Barbed Armor is naturally frustrating to play against because it's generally not a recognizable effect until it's too late (particularly in fun modes like Mid Wars).
+ Rather than nerfing it in Mid Wars, we made its effects more recognizable to more clearly deter players from damaging a target with Barbed Armor active.

 

Striders
- Recipe cost reduced from 200 to 100.
*Total cost reduced from 700 to 600.

+ Changes to Striders are part of our on-going goal of improving early-game options for Supports to keep them relevant against farmers who recently got a creep kill gold increase to help them.

 

Ultor's Heavy Helm
- Block value applied to other allies on its activation lowered from 70 to 40.
*Block value for self remains at 70.

+Ultor's Heavy Helm's active effect was granting a little too much Physical autoattack protection for the bearer's entire team, so the block values on other allies have been reduced.







 

== Public Beta Test (PBT) ==

- Map has been changed to Caldavar (PBT), with Ranked Pick mode.

 

= New Hero available for testing: Genesis (PBT) =

+ Genesis is a Legion support hero that has extra survivability compared to most supports. Her Reboot ability drops her Core Crystal to the ground upon her death, and she will revive after a short delay at that location if the Core Crystal is not destroyed.
+ She is also the first ranged support hero that will gain a shield to help win trades during the laning phase, as well as having an offensive-oriented impact with her kit throughout the game.

Radius: 2000
Range: 800

- Destroys trees in the target area.

_______________________





= Hero Reworks (PBT) =

 

Nitro (Reworked)

+ Nitro's fire-while-moving mechanic is conceptually broken/imbalanced and frustrating to deal with in this game, making her high-highs too distinct from the other levels of performance.
+ The rework maintains her hit-and-run mechanic and makes her kit much more fun overall, but allows both the Nitro player and other players in the game to interact with her more fairly.



- Now has default auto-attack behaviour.

_______________________________________________



= Heroes (PBT) =

 

Pestilence
- Flight's secondary activation fly range reduced from 1200 to 450/700/950/1200.
+ This prevents Pestilence from being overwhelmingly powerful until he invests more points into Flight.



= Items - New & Reworks (PBT) =

 

New Supportive Item: Rally's Edict

- Rally's Edict: +150% Attack Damage vs Non-Hero units, +100% Attack Damage vs Structures, Effects are halved if within 600 range of an ally hero.

+ Rally's Edict is an item that is meant to promote split-pushing without having to invest a significant amount of gold, making it a good option for pusher heroes.

 

New Protective Item: Arcane Nullifier

Armor of the Mad Mage
- Can now activate to grant yourself 60 Armor that tapers off over 6 seconds.

+  Armor of the Mad Mage lacks incentive for a particular set of tanky Intelligence heroes that like to stay in the middle of a fight to pick up this item. The former Ultor's Heavy Plate active has been transferred onto this item to fill this need.

 

Behemoth's Heart

New Poker Set Kane Avatar: Blade of Spades
- The Blade of Spades excels at disrupting the balance of power among the four suits by using his tremendous strength and resolve to overcome seemingly more powerful sets of adversaries. He's always looking for ways to draw -- or drag -- his opponents into confrontations in which they think they are guaranteed victory, only to realize too late they are woefully outmatched. They are lucky if he gives them the opportunity to fold -- most victims end up losing their cards, chips, and heads.

 

New Poker Set Pyromancer Avatar: Burn Club Pyro
- Burn Club Pyro despises hackers and cheaters of all kinds -- bottom dealers, colluders, mechanics, muckers -- and while her preferred method of dealing with them may seem extreme to some, burning down entire decks, tables, and arenas does prove quite effective. A lot of mischief can be avoided by simply burning the top card on the deck, but sometimes a proper message needs to be sent to the troublemakers and other suits to make sure they don't even think about trying any funny stuff.

 

New Poker Set Solstice Avatar: Deuces
- Though they bring different playing styles to the table, these two wild cards are both infamous for being ready to go all-in, day or night. When the sun is up they use a more defensive strategy to get a feel for their adversaries and prepare to exploit any weaknesses they uncover. But then, once the sun goes down, it's time to strike. That's when they really raise the stakes and push for a final hand, and there is no doubt they hold the sharper cards.





== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

 

= General =

 

Channelled abilities that can be used while moving without breaking the channel now get cancelled properly when the target becomes invulnerable. Skills affected are:
- Electrician's Static Grip
- Succubus' Cursed Embrace (when boosted by Staff of the Master)

- The player's selected favourite avatar will properly be picked if they run out of time in the Hero Pick phase & did not end up picking a hero.

Devourer
- Jin Chan's Guttling Hook visual now displays properly if taken & cast via Kinesis' Thoughtsteal.



Empath (PBT)
- Tablet of Command will now function properly if Empath uses the item while As One is active.

 

Engineer
- Steam Turret can no longer be healed if it inherits Magic Lifesteal from Engineer's inventory & deals any type of Magic Damage.

 

Geomancer
- Earth's Grasp's travel distance will no longer be incorrectly increased if Geomancer attempts to cast the spell backwards while Dig is active.

 

Gunblade
- Grappling Shot now properly unlinks Gunblade if the target dies.

 

Ichor
- Using Transfusion to transfer a damaging debuff to an enemy will now properly source the damage from Ichor.

 

Jeraziah

*Prevents overhead visuals from falsely appearing on certain units like King Klout's Goblin minions.

 

Master of Arms
- Overcharged Shot will no spawn the secondary projectiles from the bottom-left corner of the map if it fails to hit its original target.

 

Monkey King
- Vault can no longer target trees.
- Vault will no longer automatically cancel channeling on its own.
*The target's channel spell has a max channel range, then displacing the unit past that max channel range from the target will still break the channel, as that is a separate channel break mechanic.



Pyromancer
- Punk Pyromancer avatar upgrade visuals now function properly in all circumstances.

 

Sand Wraith
- Model quality for Wraith of Diamonds has been adjusted to be correct.



 

= Items =

New Poker Ellonia Avatar: Queen of Hearts
- The Queen of Hearts may come off as a bit frigid at first, but that's only because she's looking for tells and working to identify players ripe for bleeding. When she turns on the charm and uses her full set of assets to taunt, tease, and distract players (and possibly slip a cold deck into the mix), the rest of the table quickly tilts or steams toward a rapid fold, laydown, or all-out bust.

 

New Poker Sand Wraith Avatar: Wraith of Diamonds
- The Wraith of Diamonds is a seriously sharp and intimidating player with a deceptive style of play known as sandbagging -- he'll create the mirage of holding a weak hand in battle, luring hapless opponents into staying in when they should fold and raising aggressively when they should be more cautious. By the time his overconfident targets realize they've actually been stalked since the first card was dealt, the Wraith of Diamonds has already broken them.

 

New Poker Set Effect
- Get the Poker Carnage Counter with three of a kind, or go all-in with the five Poker avatars and get the full Set Effect!

Midas
- Elemental Warp (when boosted by Staff of the Master) can now be properly cast at max range when Nome's Wisdom (PBT version) is in his inventory.

Version 4.5.3
-------------
31 July 2018

 


= New Hero: Mimix =


When the Sacred Order cleric discovered that the shapes and hexes used on the profane Hellbourne sacrificial shrines actually harnessed the power to create daemonic energy, he knew that power could be reversed. It could become a destroyer.

He immersed himself in the math, the sequences, and the potential for disruptions within. At first he experimented with quill and ink, watching with disbelief as the shapes, when arranged correctly and applied to opposing shapes, destroyed each other. And each time, always, the more perfect geometry was the victor. He moved to solid objects, carving replicas of the Hellbourne shapes into boulders. When confronted with certain sacred geometries by the cleric, the stones split apart as if made of clay. He was ecstatic! Using these shapes to battle the daemonic infrastructure could turn the tide of the war.

Then, a revelation: A warrior who accurately mimicked these shapes and carried them with him, on him, within him, would be unstoppable. He began by carving the geometries into his flesh, carefully cleansing the wounds to create scars, but the shapes were too jagged, too imperfect. He knew they would fail when clashing with the flawless Hellbourne symbols. So he took the remaining metal shapes and placed them in the glowing coals of his fire, let them linger until red-hot, and pressed them into his skin to create immaculate brands. He even left a few of the metal symbols embedded in his body to ensure the quality.

And it worked. His body was now a weapon, and when he approached the boulders and logs decorated with daemonic symbolism, they crumbled and splintered before him. He fantasized about strolling into Hellbourne territory, smirking as the corrupted landscape was decimated by his mere presence.

But then the sacred shapes began to change his body. They grew, twisted, and contorted, taking the flesh with them. The transformation was agonizing but thrilling, for the cleric knew the geometry was aligning his body in the ideal patterns and ratios for maximum destructive power. When the perfection was complete, he felt the power immediately. The sacred energies gathered within him, ready to burst forth at his command. He was even able to replicate his new sequence of shapes, expanding his power exponentially. The Sacred Order praised their new warrior, who would literally reshape the war for the Legion.

= Mimix =

 

New Early Access Mimix Avatar: Unity
- While the geometry of the sacred paradigm can render catastrophic destruction, it can also bring objects together and bind them with nearly unbreakable bonds. Unity is a master of this sorcery, and his ability to serve as a spiritual artisan to augment his abilities and those of his reflections is a powerful counter to the Hellbourne's desire to tear all of Newerth apart.

 

New Mimix Avatar: Severence
- Although the cleric known as Mimix only recently discovered the destructive power of geometric symbols, this weapon has been known to other beings since the first shapes were scribbled in the dust of creation. Severance is a warrior from the phantom realm, where the spirit and physical are forever fractured, and he brings to Newerth an obsession with separating souls from their mortal prisons. Whether through phantom sorcery or simple, pedestrian brutality, he will shatter these shells and bask in the glory of the souls releasing into his realm.

 

= General =

 

+ The Birthday Basher and Cake Snake are a vicious team of party crashers who work together to invade birthday parties and decimate all sweets and presents before stampeding away, leaving splattered plates and sobbing children in their wake as they hunt for the next party to ruin.

 

New Predator Avatar: Birthday Basher
- The Birthday Basher has an insatiable need to open and gorge upon any wrapped gift it sees, and birthday presents are especially delectable. Children across Newerth ignore their parents' pleas to slow down and relish the anticipation of gift-unwrapping, for the kids know the Birthday Basher is lurking nearby, stalking the presents and preparing to leap into the pile, shredding ribbons, paper, and boxes alike to get at the prizes hidden within. The poor birthday boys and girls may get a brief glimpse of their presents before they're wolfed down by this monster, but then the toys are gone, along with any hope of enjoying the rest of the party.

 

New Slither Avatar: Cake Snake
- Birthday party-goers across Newerth live in constant fear of the Cake Snake. This nefarious creature lurks among the balloons, bounce houses, and pinatas at these joyous gatherings, waiting for the perfect moment to burst forth. Its appearance instantly scatters the screaming children and crushes the hopes of the birthday boy or girl, who watches with helpless horror as the Cake Snake uses its grotesquely enlarged spoon and fork to devour all birthday cake, ice cream, cookies, and treats. Then it slithers away, momentarily sated until it finds the next batch of cakes and dreams to destroy.

New Punks of Newerth Pollywog Priest Avatar: Punk Polly
- You can recognize Punk Polly's pieces at a glance -- if an adorable frog is in there somewhere, it's Polly's. She's certain that by covering all of Newerth with the goofy googly eyes, slappy tongues and gorgeous green, she'll bring so much joy to the streets that no one will want to fight anymore. That fact that any rival gangs (and maybe a few Punks) would want to slash her precious froggies is completely baffling to her, and just further proof that they need more cutie patootie frogs in their lives.

 

New Punks of Newerth Doctor Repulsor Avatar: Punk Repulsor
- Punk Repulsor is the tastemaker for this pack of wild artists, constantly searching for inspirations that will bring about the next hot flavor of graffiti for her crew. Drifting down streets and alleys in her tag chariot, she slashes any pieces she deems unworthy of Newerth's glorious canvas -- even if they came from a Punk -- and highlights the masterpieces worth preserving. The Punks are naturally drawn to her electrifying energy, and when she spots a rival artist with potential to become a Punk, she uses her magnetic personality to draw them close for a private chat. Depending on how that goes, her recruits either join the Punks of Newerth or end up a beautiful splatter on the wall.

New Soulstealer Avatar: Soulchiller
- The prevailing theory among those who dwell in the Frost Fields is that death by hypothermia is somewhat peaceful: you're freezing, then you feel an overwhelming sense of warmth and sleepiness, then you simply fade away. The major flaw with this assumption is that everyone who completes the process is dead and cannot confirm or refute the details. The Soulchiller of the Frost Fields is more than happy to perpetuate this belief, for when her freezing victims see her beautiful form approaching with her playful, mischievous snowflake fairies, they think she brings rescue with her. In truth, her lovely visage conceals an elemental daemon who freezes the exterior of her victims so she can drain their essence at her leisure. Her prey may look like they've simply frozen to death -- perhaps even peacefully -- but inside they are screaming in agony as she slowly extracts their soul.

New Circe Avatar: Exiled Circe
- In ancient days it was the wanderers and adventurers who fell victim to the sorceress known as Circe the Deceiver, drawn to the island prison by her enchanted disguises of long-lost loved ones, missing sailors, even gods they worshipped and believed they had found.
In the days of the Lost Civilization, Circe grew weak as Man refined his gift of science; he knew all corners of the earth and had no sense of exploration. Circeâ€™s wanderers dwindled, then vanished. The sorceress waited alone on her island for centuries, scanning the horizons for a glimpse of a topsail or debris from a shipwreck.
When a ship finally appeared, Circe did not believe her eyes. The hard iron surfaces gleamed in the sun and looked nothing like the last vessel she had seen, one carved of wood and held together with pitch and rope; this craft soared through the air, though it had no feathered wings. The Deceiver remained concealed as the object landed on her warm sand. She did not trust it, for it defied the laws of nature and could only be sent by the gods, who had exiled her to this island so long ago.
When the craft opened and mortal men stepped out, Circeâ€™s doubts began to be replaced by hope. She followed these men as they explored her island, holding iron boxes with flashing colors. They seemed very pleased by the colors. When the chance arose, Circe lured one of the men into the jungle and enchanted him to gain the purpose of his visit.
The man told her all: he and his fellow explorers sought elements, though the names he gave meant nothing to Circe. But when she gleaned from his mind the purpose of those elements she saw fire and destruction on a scale that would shame the gods. Circe allowed the men to leave with their findings, and for years allowed them to return and extract what they liked from the soil and bedrock of her island. The Deceiver took her share of the workers, casting spells to convince the others that the missing men had been lost to accidents and desertion.
Then the men left, for they had taken everything they could from her prison. Circe was once again alone. But the images of fire remained, and hundreds of years later in what came to be known as Manâ€™s Fall from Light, Circe watched the horizons grow bright with an unnatural glow. Storms of ash swept over her island and massive structures made of stone and shattered glass were carried on the tides. Charred corpses washed ashore by the hundreds.
As Circe had foreseen in the explorerâ€™s mind, the waters surrounding her island fell away, evaporated by the unholy flames that spread beneath boiling black clouds. After thousands of years a prisoner, Circe walked off her island toward what remained of mankind, for her island was now the entire world.

 

New Engineer Avatar: Ol' Briarpatch
- Ol' Briarpatch doesn't have much need or use for people or animals, as most of them don't have much need or use for him and his crotchety ways. But his beloved greenhouse, now that's another story. His precious pitcher plants wouldn't survive without his careful watering, pruning, and singing, which to warm-blooded ears sounds like a drowning accordion. They were all perfectly content being left alone by the world, but the world decided to come barging in when a battle between the Legion and Hellbourne spilled from a nearby field onto their property and left acres of dead plants behind. Properly riled, Ol' Briarpatch rallied the survivors and armed them, these glorious green soldiers of his, and they set out to stick a giant thorn in the side of world.

 

New Fayde Avatar: Bloodshadow
- The Dragonblood Clan of Arasunia dates back to the city's first days as a simple crossroads with a chapel, and their vow to protect the citizens from all threats -- including the church -- has survived and evolved along with the spectacular city. Those who belong to the secret society operate in the shadows, collecting information, whispering rumors, and applying leverage as needed to maintain the precarious balance between what is lawful and what is just. When that balance tips too far either way, certain members of the clan are called upon to cull the source and return order. Bloodshadow is the elite among these professional assassins, and when he unleashes the full power of his Dragonblood upon the clan's target you can be certain their shadow will remain forever still.

 

New Riptide Avater: Mecha Mermaid
- It's always dangerous when electricity and water mix, and Mecha Mermaid could be the most lethal combination in all of Newerth. Once a beautiful, naive sea nymph, this warrior witnessed the vast, careless destruction caused by the Legion and Hellbourne fleets when they engaged in sea battles and knew her kind would be quickly wiped out if no one intervened on their behalf. Though she was wary of mankind, it was obvious that the daemons had no love for the natural world and its inhabitants, so she volunteered to augment her powerful aquatic abilities with the mecha arsenal designed by Legion Engineers. The results are about to create a tidal wave of trouble for the Hellbourne.

________________________



Version 4.5.0
-------------
19 June 2018





== Design ==



= Matchmaking =



- 4-player and 5-player queue restrictions have been lifted.
*Groups of 4 players can queue together for matchmaking once again.
*Groups of 5 players can now be matched against all group combinations (but will still prioritize being matched against other 5-man queues).





= General =



- Ranged Lane Creep aggro range reduced from 800 to 600.
*This change finds a good compromise in the lane dynamics between suicide heroes and support heroes.

 

- Neutral Creep (non-player controlled) aggro range increased from 150 to 225.
*This change allows heroes to more reasonably stack & pull camps without physically attacking them, as the previous aggro range was too small.



- Mana consumption over time and dynamic mana costs now interacts properly with Balphagore's Belly of the Beast ability (PBT) and Nome's Wisdom's healing/shielding effect (Regular Modes).
*Examples of such sources include (but are not limited to): Parallax's Earthshatter, Adrenaline's active abilities, Torturer's Torment, Scout's Vanish, Chi's A Thousand Cuts, Doctor Repulsor's Ludicrous Speed.

= The Bloodwar Brood =



+ The Bloodwar Brood are a band of disgraced Sang-La Warriors who were once the pinnacle of honor and bushido, but fell to the lure of corrupted power. Though cursed, they still carry with them the ancient traditions of the Honors of War. No matter who they face on the battlefield â€“ even each other â€“ they consider the act of combat a sacred undertaking, worthy of the utmost respect. This honor is unbreakable, even when the flesh and soul are completely ruined by Hellbourne corruption.



New Accursed Bloodwar Brood Avatar: General Noroi
- The samurai General Noroi had only lost one battle, but one was too many. He had failed his feudal lord â€“ his daimyo â€“ and the laws of the Sang-La warriors demanded he pay the ultimate price of seppuku. The daemons now surrounded his lord's castle high in the mountains, having carved through the general's army with horrifying ease. The Hellbourne's commander was a merciless tyrant called Lord Salforis, and his mission was to desecrate the estate's sacred burial sites, searching for something only a twisted necromancer like him could know. The daimyo knew it was simply a matter of time before the castle fell and his people were slaughtered, but he would order his soldiers to fight to the bitter end. And he would have his penance from the general who had humiliated him.

But he was wrong. As General Noroi knelt before him, preparing to reach for his tanto, the feudal lord thought the coward was praying. But the samurai was reciting the words whispered to him by Lord Salforis himself â€“ words that would doom the general to an afterlife of undead agony, but would allow his family and the daimyo's people to leave the castle alive. As soon as he uttered the final, guttural words and plunged the tanto into his abdomen, his ever-faithful kaishakunin delivered the instant death blow, severing Noroi's head. The daimyo smiled, relishing what would likely be his last moment of true power before the wholesale slaughter began. That smile froze on his face as the samurai general's body stood, picked up his head, and bludgeoned the daimyo to death with it. So began General Noroi's service to a new master -- corruption -- and his reign of terror over the living lords.



New Magmus Bloodwar Brood Avatar: Saji
- Saji the bladesmith was famous across all of Sang-La for the beautifully lethal katana, wakizashi, tanto, and kodachi he created for the samurai. A master of the sacred arts of forging, folding, shaping, polishing, and sharpening, he would often disappear into his forge for weeks, needing only rice and water amid the blistering heat and cacophony of hammer blows, to emerge holding a priceless blade created for a specific set of hands down to the thickness of the thread used on the suka. When the corruption came for him, it came quietly. A man he did not know requested a blade for the legendary General Noroi, a blade that would be used to defend his daimyo's castle from the nightmarish invaders rumored to be approaching from the east. The man even brought a gift, a sack of high-grade tamahagane to use for the blade's steel. Saji put his current work aside to focus on Noroi's blade, unaware that the gifted ore he used had been mined from the caverns beneath Blackwal and carried an insidious form of corruption. The smoke, dust, and sparks he created while forging the blade all carried this corruption, and it seeped into Saji's lunges, pores, and soul.

He felt nothing at first, but when the nameless man took the blade away to present it to General Noroi, Saji felt a great emptiness. Though he was ashamed to admit it, he wanted to see the blade cut, slash, and stab. He wanted to be near it, see it perform, watch it set the blood free. He followed the peasant roads to the great daimyo's estate, arriving just in time to see his beloved blade remove General Noroi's head. The corruption within him burst free in celebration of the victory, rending his flesh and setting him afire, and Saji collapsed in shame when he realized the katana he created had wrought such carnage. Still, he could not resist the corruption in his blood, which compelled him to follow General Noroi and his cursed blade on their reign of terror. It did not take long for him to join in.



New Rally Bloodwar Brood Avatar: Kyugo
- Second in command to the great General Noroi, Kyugo is arguably a more skilled samurai because of the countless battles he engaged in to save his general from having to bloody his own blade. Noroi would have doubtlessly been triumphant as well, but Kyugo knew the general had much greater things to concern himself with. Kyugo's greatest pride came when Noroi never even knew how close he'd come to death, a moment that happened time and again during the epic battle against Lord Salforis' army outside the daimyo's estate. While Kyugo was successful in keeping his general alive, they failed as soldiers and were forced to retreat within the walls. And though Kyugo prayed it would not happen, Noroi made the inevitable request for his dearest samurai to serve as his kaishakunin, severing the general's head after the he disemboweled himself in seppuku. This was a great, heartbreaking honor, and Kyugo performed it perfectly.

But when General Noroi's decapitated body stood and murdered the daimyo, Kyugo instantly knew his service to the great warrior was not done. He willingly submitted to the corruption flowing from the general and his great blade, allowing it to seep into the many cuts and scrapes he wore from the battle. And though the honor within him began an endless clash with the profane corruption, his devotion to General Noroi had never been stronger.

New The Madman 2018 World Cup Avatar: The Playmaker
- The Playmaker may look like a bundle of chaotic cleats zipping across the pitch, but his methods have a brilliant madness to them. Just when the opposition expects him to be in one spot, he rolls into an attacking position and quickly crosses the ball to a teammate or slashes through the defense himself to put the ball in the net. His unconventional, high-risk, and incredibly creative playing style may drive opponents (and sometimes his own coach) berserk, but the golden boots, medals, and balls at the end of the games prove that while it might sometimes look messy, the Playmaker's style is pure artistry.



New 2018 World Cup Avatar: Wing-Back Dampeer
- Wing-backs have a heavy emphasis on attacking, which suits Wing-back Dampeer absolutely fine, but in a pinch he's happy to swoop back on defense and terrorize an opposing striker to keep them from scoring. He isn't sure what's more rewarding -- scoring a goal himself or constantly harassing an opponent and completely draining them of energy, leaving them exhausted and desperate for a refuel at halftime, if they even make it that long.

= General =



Sha Wujing
- Once an honored general in heaven, Sha Wujing accidentally (or so he claims) destroyed a vase that belonged to the Jade Emperor. Enraged, the emperor exiled him to The Great Waste where Sha Wujing was reborn as a hideous man-eating sand demon. There, he suffered for centuries and took his vengeance out on anyone unlucky enough to wander close enough for him to feast upon. The only moment of joy in his miserable existence occurred when nine monks who worshiped the Jade Emperor stumbled upon Sha Wujing's lair; he devoured them one-by-one and threw their skulls into the fetid river, but instead of sinking like the rest of his victims, these floated. Fascinated, Sha Wujing examined them and found that they were blessed and enchanted by the emperor himself. Perhaps this power could be harnessed...

Sha Wujing strung the skulls together and wore them as a necklace, and he laughed heartily at the irony as the combined strength of their enchantment allowed him to break free of his prison. He also laughed as he imagined the look on the Jade Emperor's face when he finally found and confronted him again, telling him his boot-licking monks had provided the key to Sha Wujing's freedom. As he began his hunt, Sha Wujing wished for a way to make the emperor's agony last as long as his own had...

+ The Four Symbols were thought to be mythological creatures who dwelled among the constellations, but as the future of Newerth teeters on the brink of disaster, these honorable beings reveal themselves to be not only real, but also incredibly powerful.


New Four Symbols Bubbles Avatar: Black Tortoise
- The frozen climate of the North may be endless and unwelcoming to some, but the lovely Black Tortoise of the North adores it. The time spent indoors allows her to gather much wisdom and spend countless hours studying the gorgeous, powerful crystals she finds buried beneath the snow with the help of her snake companion. The two of them make a formidable pair in battle, with the Tortoise providing a very somber, studied approach to any who threaten her people or seek to steal her gems, while the snake prefers to be much more of a...well...snake.

 

New Four Symbols Prophet Avatar: Vermilion Bird
- The Vermilion Bird of the South embodies the full beauty of peak summer, when the scorching heat and dry conditions offer ample opportunities for a good cleansing fire to sweep through and rid the land of undesirable inhabitants. Now that she has set foot upon Newerth, this includes the corrupted Hellbourne, who cannot help but admire the elegance of the Vermilion Bird and her graceful flames, even as they are engulfed by them.

New Plague Rider Avatar: Plume Rider
- The Plume Riders of Fuathmoor bring a dazzling display of color and flair to an otherwise dreary landscape of fog, bogs and hummocks. The village children and offspring of the Poison-Plumed Harriers are paired at a young age to foster trust and an uncanny, unspoken communication that allows them to fly in perfect, graceful harmony. Originally used only for ceremonies to honor warriors heading off to battle and welcome back the lucky survivors, they were forced to evolve into warriors themselves when the Hellbourne rose and no survivors returned from the slaughter. Now, the riders and harriers use both spear and poison feathers to drive the corrupted out of their land, and they sing of the day when they can be part of the ceremony celebrating the end of this terrible war.

= The Four Symbols =



+ The Four Symbols were thought to be mythological creatures who dwelled among the constellations, but as the future of Newerth teeters on the brink of disaster, these honorable beings reveal themselves to be not only real, but also incredibly powerful.

 

Azure Dragon
- The Azure Dragon of the East is linked to the cleansing rebirth of spring and its clear blue waters, which she uses in copious amounts from her dragon cannon to purge Newerth of anything unjust. Her benevolence and delivery of good fortune is a blessing to those who follow the path of honor, and a bane to those who stray from it.


White Tiger
- The White Tiger of the West embodies the transitional season of autumn, when crops are harvested and preparations are made to defend against the coming winter. While she is more than happy to assist and guide her people in those tasks, she never falters in her true purpose: vigilance against the terrors -- both physical and spiritual -- who lurk in the growing shadows of fall. Her element is metal, and her enchanted, razor-sharp claws never grow dull when reaping a full harvest of forage...or corrupted enemies.

 

Four Symbols Set Effect
- Display the full power of all four directions and seasons when you own every avatar in the Four Symbols Set:
* Azure Dragon Sapphire
* Black Tortoise Bubbles
* Vermillion Bird Prophet
* White Tiger Dark Lady

 

= General =

 

Carhop Tarot
- Carhop Tarot is legendary for her speedy service, sassy banter, and uncanny ability to guess every customer's order before they even see the menu. Sure, sometimes she's too busy showing off her server skills to care if her guess is actually right, and she's always zipping off to the next customer before anyone can complain about no ketchup, too much ketchup, or getting blasted in the face by a burger -- but she'll always be back to collect her tips. Order up!


Nebula
- The Cruxlords and Artificers may be extremely efficient at destroying physical planets, but they are woefully inept at eliminating the concepts that allow civilizations to survive and thrive -- tenets like truth, compassion, and forbearance. These are invisible to the physical senses and alien sensors, yet they are as real as the shards and dust floating through space after the Fulcrums do their heinous work, and they have drawn together across galaxies to form the being known as Nebula. Completely pure and virtuous, Nebula requires no effort to resist evil, respect life, and work for the good of others, for those are its default path. However, it also knows the truest way to show compassion for other is to allow them to live their lives, an opportunity that will be lost should the Cruxlords and Artificers prevail. Because of this, Nebula must bring all of its celestial power to the fight against these monsters and add their dust and ash to the incalculable pile they've already created. 

 

 

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==



= General =



- Connectivity errors regarding Matchmaking (e.g. team roster errors and disconnect errors after finding a match when queuing in Matchmaking) are now fixed.

- Base Gold bounty value is now properly set to 200 for a hero kill.
*Was mistakenly set to 350 due to a mismerge.

- Malphas' AI is now more robust and responsive.

Monkey King
- Illusive Dash: when the second activation state expires, it no longer performs its second Illusive Dash automatically if Monkey King is Silenced or Restrained/Immobilized (in addition to if Monkey King is Stunned).
*Fix applies for PBT & regular modes.

== Community ==



= HoNiversary =



- May 12th of this year marks a huge moment in Heroes of Newerth history as we observe HoN's 8th year as a major online multiplayer game. To commemorate this occasion, this HoNiversary's celebrations include a whopping 50% gold sale (May 11th until May 15th), triple diamond odds (May 16 until May 23rd) in Plinko and a 3x silver bonus (May 8th until May 22th)! Merrick also has been gracious enough to sell Limited Edition and Holiday Edition avatars again during this celebration (May 7th until May 24th).

- The fun doesn't end there! Merrick also made his own grab bags he's putting up for sale filled to the brim with Holiday Edition, Limited Edition, Gold, Ultimate, Early Access and Debut Edition Avatars! Grab them before they run out! (May 8th until May 22th) 

- Our trusty Newerthian friends will be celebrating this wonderful day with us. Look forward to entertaining in-game changes to some of your HoN's favorite units. 





== Public Beta Test (PBT) ==



+ Public Beta Test (PBT) is the new game mode that brings a hardcore, ruthless & unforgiving gameplay experience that Heroes of Newerth was originally known for, and the environment that its legacy players thrive in. It brings back a large majority of the gameplay mechanics that HoN used to have, while simultaneously breathing life into the gameplay with a new map, new bosses, and a revamped hero pool and item pool.



+ PBT is also the mode where players can test changes potentially coming to the main mode in the future! All on 1 client, with little to no extra assets required to be downloaded each patch.



+ This mode will be available to play in the Map Rotation slot on the Mode Select screen until further notice.



+ The compilation of the full changelog throughout PBT's lifetime will be available in the Public Beta Test (PBT) Feedback forums.



+ Note that unless stated otherwise, all section headers with "(PBT)" or "(PBT Only)" mentions will only apply to the PBT mode. These particular changes will not affect all game modes!





= PBT Feedback =



+ All players now have a clear voice if they wish to see something changed! Simply fill out the feedback form at the end of every PBT game and make your comments concise, constructive, and justified.



+ Additionally, players can visit the Public Beta Test (PBT) Feedback section in the official HoN forums and have a more centralized location of constructive feedback. The PBT Feedback subforums will be located directly below the General Discussion forums, and are a place for having more elaborate balance/design discussions pertaining to PBT. This is the best way to ensure that your feedback is seen and taken into consideration!





= Ranked Pick =



New Picking Mode: Ranked Pick

+ Ranked Pick is our new competitive picking mode. This mode allows everyone on your team to have an influence on Hero Bans and Hero Picks, and does not restrict that influence to the player with the highest Rank on your team. Because of its pick mode mechanics, Ranked Pick encourages teamwork and strategic drafting to maximize your team's synergy and counter the opponent's hero picks and strategies.

+ PBT's Pick Mode will be Ranked Pick.



Banning Phase
- The game starts with 20 seconds for every player to vote for Blind Banning heroes.
*Each player only has 2 votes.
*A player may choose to make 0 votes or 1 vote if they wish.
*Players can only see their own votes.
- After all Blind Bans are made or until the timer expires, the game bans the top 4 heroes that have the most votes for being Blind Banned.
*No indication of how many votes were made for each hero are given to players.
- If 4 heroes with the most votes for being Blind Banned cannot be chosen because of ties, then the game chooses randomly between the ones that require a tiebreaker.
*e.g. There is a 3-2-2-1-1-1 distribution for Blind Ban votes. The game will select the 3-2-2 heroes, but the remaining heroes with the 1 Blind Ban on each of them will be randomly selected for the 4th hero.


Picking Phase
- A random team is chosen to pick first.
- Any player from the team can pick a hero for themselves. When the number of picks per team in a turn is done, it switches to the other team.
- The number of picks per team when alternating picking turns is: 1-2-2-2-2-1.
- Picking time per turn is 30 seconds. If the 30 seconds expires and picks are not fully used for that turn, the game will pick a random hero for the top-most player on that team for the remaining hero picks that turn, giving priority to players that have a hero shadowpicked.
- Once all players have picked their hero, a 20 second time period is provided for players to briefly discuss their general strategy and to swap heroes (if necessary).





= Map Changes (PBT Only) =



+ Forests of Caldavar (PBT) has received a complete overhaul.



- The entire map received new textures and visual updates!
- Legion and Hellbourne bases have been streamlined and had excess buildings removed, reducing the amount of congestion in fights within the bases.
- The World Tree and Sacrificial Shrine, along with their two Tier 4 towers, have been moved to a higher elevation level than the Barracks.
- The Legion Well and Hellbourne Tarpit have been moved to a higher elevation than the Main Base Structure, making fountain spawn camping even more difficult than before.
- Top and bottom lanes had their treelines revamped on the sides of the lane, allowing for more aggressive and sneaky plays for both teams.
- Top and bottom lanes now have an Easy pull camp for the Safe (commonly known as "short") Lane, and a Medium pull camp for the Unsafe (commonly known as the "long" or "off") Lane, allowing for increased contention and further diversifying lane dynamics.
*Heroes in their Safe Lane can pull their Easy camp at ~x:15/x:45.
*Heroes in their Safe Lane can pull the Medium camp at ~x:55.
*Heroes in their Unsafe Lane can pull the Medium camp at ~x:15 (if on Hellbourne) or ~x:19 (if on Legion).



- Efficient, yet obvious marked ward spots have been added! Players can choose to ward in these locations, but expect to be counterwarded much more frequently if you choose to do so.
*Moderately skilled players will counterward relentlessly, which means that higher skilled players will discover ward spots that avoid these commonly counterwarded locations.
*Improvise your warding game by dynamically changing your ward locations and finding new ones!



- The number of juke spots on the map has been increased overall, notably in the jungle areas and around the middle lane!
*This allows for a higher skill ceiling of plays around those areas, as it now becomes more probable to escape from a sticky situation if you are skillful enough at juking!



- Balance has been improved between the Legion and Hellbourne jungle.
- Both jungles have been modified to allow for better neutral camp clearing rotations throughout the game.
- An Ancient neutral camp has been added to the jungle, increasing the total number of camps from 5 to 6 in the actual jungle!
- Golem Bosses now reside near the legacy Ancient neutral camp locations (more details below!)
*The legacy Ancient neutral camp is still there, it has been shifted appropriately with respect to the Golem Boss locations.




= New Bosses: Golem Boss (PBT Only) =



+ Kongor has been replaced with 2 Golem Bosses. One Golem will be on the Legion's side of the map (East of the top Tier 2 tower), while the other Golem will be on Hellbourne's side of the map (to the west of the bottom Tier 2 tower). Killing one of these Golem Bosses grants your team permanent buffs, while killing both Golem Bosses within a short amount of time gives you extra Sieging power to destroy structures, allowing teams to have an easier time ending games more quickly.

= Hero Pool (PBT) =



+ At an early point in its lifetime, hero designs in the long term were being hindered by multiple decisions: these include overloading a hero's kit with too many tools (with many simply being "tack-ons") & making them all some form of semi-carries, or allowing carries to be strong at all phases of the game, thus making them "hyper carries". By doing this, it makes the hero pool more homogenized, making a portion of the hero pool obsolete, and makes each hero less unique & draftable relative to other heroes. This also introduces the problem of powercreeping when introducing new heroes, as all new heroes feel compelled to have their kit overloaded with every tool to make them feel up to par with the most recent heroes, thus making the problem worse in the long term.



+ To fix these issues, a large portion of heroes are temporarily removed from the game, and will eventually be reintroduced back into the game over time as their hero designs are changed to make them fit better in the new hero pool. Many previous hero designs have also been changed in certain areas to minimize overlap between heroes.



+ Heroes have also received changes to make them have draftability, i.e. have a reason to be picked on the Hero Pick screen to either grant a unique benefit to their team, facilitate a strategy, or specifically counter certain heroes/strategies on the opposing team.



+ To reduce the amount of hybrid/semi-carry heroes that are too good at all phases of the game, some heroes have had their power adjusted relative to each phase of the game. In general, support heroes have been tailored to excel in the early game, gankers have been tailored to control game tempo and thus control early-mid game, while carries will dominate late game & have much less of a dominance early-mid game.

= Summary of Hero Changes (PBT Only) =



Andromeda
- Andromedaâ€™s rework shifts her into a long range harass and poke hero who can now take full advantage of her Void Rip ability. This direction pushes her further from a walking ultimate and gives her a little more depth, as well as increasing her lane strength so she can support more effectively.



Armadon
- Armadon is a hero that wants to be in the middle of teamfights, but lacked any inherent mobility (unless he wasted spellcasts to get the benefits of Restless). His ultimate now allows him a way to get right in the middle of fights or pursue a fleeing enemy, dealing a burst of damage to get the party started. Additionally, the frustration of Armordillo automatically casting Spine Burst has been removed, replaced with Mana replenishment whenever Armadon takes hits from behind. This increases the counterplay options available to his enemies while also allowing Armadon the agency to choose when to expend his Spine Bursts.



Behemoth
- Behemoth still boasts his classic burst of lethality to his foes if they clump up too closely together. To facilitate his function without the need of a Portal Key and allow his item build paths to be more flexible, he has been given an initiation tool on his Enrage, allowing him to leap to a location.



Blood Hunter
- Blood Hunter is the premier single target silence ganker in PBT, and will remain a great counter to heroes who rely on mobility or blinking. He is still one of the stronger solo middle lane heroes with his ability to sustain himself through Feast.



Bubbles
- Bubbles was brought up to PBT levels a long time ago, which is why he may have been perceived as being a little too strong in retail. His kit is enjoyable, however, and not much has changed. The speed of Shell Surf was a little too fast for most players to dodge even at mid to long ranges, so it has been slowed down.



Chi
- Chi has a unique mechanic for punishing heroes that obtain high Attack Damage. There are many heroes that punish increasing Attack Speed through blinds or slows, but not too many for Attack Damage, making Chi one of the best counters to this strategy. As he was recently added to the main game, his abilities are the same.



Chipper
- Chipper has always been played as a basic nuker who blinks on top of an enemy and spews out all the damage he can, but this is neither interesting compared to other nukers in the pool nor relevant to the design of his main damage tool, Rocket Barrage. The changes to Chipper are meant to provide a new strategy that works much better with his intended role as a long-range poke machine, punishing him for being too close and rewarding him for keeping his distance.



Chronos
- Chronos is a classic hero who received a few changes to give his abilities a little more playaround. Rewind is no longer randomly activated, granting more control to both the Chronos player and his opponent when deciding how to approach a fight and when to use or prevent the ability. Additionally, Curse of Ages now provides Chronos with a second attack instead of a bash, which not only reduces frustration when fighting Chronos, but also gives him more opportunity to proc attack items, removes redundancy when enemies are trapped in a Chronofield, and fits better with his theme of time manipulation.



Corrupted Disciple
- Corrupted Disciple will remain as the classic counter-carry hero with his Attack Damage draining trait.



Demented Shaman
- Demented Shaman has returned to his roots as a full blown hard support, capable of providing massive survivability through Unbreakable and the ability to turn fights over time with the armor swing from Storm Cloud, making him a great complementary pickup with armor-based teams. This not only solidifies his role in the game, but also helps bridge the gap between how he is played in different regions.



Devourer
- Devourer has one of the most fun kits in the game, and thus has not received much change. He has been given some buffs to become more tanky as the game progresses, but his mechanics remain the same.



Empath
- Empathâ€™s identity is the same, capable of turning her allies into carries (or even harder carries, if theyâ€™re already carries), but her global Health regeneration has been removed as it isn't necessary in her kit. It has been replaced with the movement speed boost (now called â€œSpurâ€) she would have otherwise only gotten by using As One, which allows her more flexibility and ability synergy when As One is on cooldown. Spurâ€™s effectiveness in general has also been increased, making this skill impactful in more situations.



Engineer
- Engineer had some issues where most players found Spider Mines to be a stressful addition to the game, as it promotes a playstyle that is frustrating for both teams to deal with. These have been removed so that Engineerâ€™s unique method of stopping initiation with his ultimate could be the cornerstone of his playstyle. Engineer has gone back to his roots and is now more suited to carry with his legacy-based Turret, complete with new balance tweaks.



Fayde
- Fayde has been changed to an all-around ganking threat that focuses more on larger HP targets. If her team needs an anti-strength hero, sheâ€™s a great option, and now has a tool that actually allows her to escape if things go awry.



Flint Beastwood
- Flint Beastwood has a little more control over his abilities now, allowing him to increase his Hollowpoint Shells damage when he needs it. He has gained the unique ability to provide True Strike for himself and allies while remaining the longest ranged carry in the game.



Forsaken Archer
- Forsaken Archer had the tools to be a hard carry who specializes in auto-attacking everyone around her with Split Fire, so it didnâ€™t make much sense that Crippling Volley limited her victims to one or two at a time, or that Piercing Arrows was little more than a high damage line nuke on a hero whose damage output should be relative to her farm. With this in mind, her new abilities shift her further from ganking and burst damage spells, and closer to farming and excelling through auto-attacks against multiple enemy heroes at once. Her new ultimate provides an area miss chance to all nearby enemies, making her a great counter to teams who rely on their auto-attacks for damage.



Glacius
- Glacius remains as a reliable, aggressive, and classic support hero that provides a global Mana Regeneration aura to his team. His power level has been increased to match other heroes in PBT, including the numbers of Chilling Presence, which are now especially powerful for Glacius himself, allowing him to harass much more effectively with his spells.



Gladiator
- Gladiator is the most satisfying to play when heâ€™s able to one-shot the enemy team after successfully landing his full combo. In PBT he is very close to his retail counterpart, but Call to Arms now grants himself and his allies a guaranteed crit when it comes charging by, increasing the likelihood that Gladiator can achieve this feeling and obtain a team wipe if heâ€™s placed everything properly.



Gunblade
- Gunblade has been changed to a melee hero, as the melee/range duality in his initial design did not actually play out the way it was intended in real games; in most cases, Gunblade would simply wait until Grappling Shot was available before he would engage in combat, nullifying his range advantage. As the most fun part of his skillset, Grappling Shot is now available much more often, and Lethal Range has increased significantly in its potential damage output. Additionally, he is now able to track enemies as they flee by causing them to bleed out, aiding his aesthetic as the iconic undead sheriff and giving him a little more usefulness if heâ€™s not able to finish off his target.



Hammerstorm
- Hammerstorm is a great carry for many reasons, but lacked something that made him a powerhouse in certain strategies over others. Now when he activates Brute Strength, ally heroes will receive a buff to their own Base Damage, giving Hammerstorm an edge in lineups that benefit from amplified auto-attacks.



Hellbringer
- Hellbringer has always had something worth drafting with the superior stun in Summon Malphas, but having to control both Hellbringer and Malphas during this time never made much sense, as Hellbringer didnâ€™t have much damage output and the multi-unit control turned many players away. His rework allows the player to focus solely on Hellbringer, constantly barraging enemies with low cooldown spells and staying alive while Malphas seeks out enemies to attack on his own.



Jeraziah
- Jeraziah's Protective Charm was fundamentally imbalanced, as most of the game had previously been balanced around Magic Immunity sources. Giving an ally that effect as early as level 1 did not do the game any favours, and also made Jeraziah more played as a support hero instead of a semi-carry hero. By replacing Protective Charm with a heavy Slow and granting him impactful damage on his third ability, Jeraziah remains as a semi-carry hero that also provides his team with heavy Physical Damage mitigation.



Klanx
- Klanx is a simple and fun Attack Speed carry, but lacked something unique to make him worthy of a pickup over other auto-attackers. To remedy this, his new ultimate provides bonus Attack Speed to nearby allies for a short duration, allowing him to synergize well with other heroes who could make use of the buff. Flight has been further balanced to make dealing with him less frustrating, and his early game power has been severely decreased since he is intended to be a late-game carry. Additionally, B.A.N.G. now Blinds affected units, granting this fragile mastermind a little more survivability if he manages to land it properly.



Kraken
- Kraken has always had the potential to devastate multiple enemies, but due to the design of his abilities, he rarely got the chance, and is often relegated to more of a single-target ganker role. He has received some changes to his ultimate that will allow him to fulfill his potential and capture multiple enemies, streamlining his kit and giving him a more defined niche in the game as an enemy team relocator.



Legionnaire
- Legionnaireâ€™s power curve is often incredibly binary depending on his performance early game. If he excels early on, he gains the levels and items needed & tends to snowball out of control because of the scaling on his Terrifying Charge. If he is stopped early on, he can never seem to catch up to the gameâ€™s current tempo because he is so dependent on levels and items. As a result, Legionnaireâ€™s Terrifying Charge (and power) is now oriented towards the early-mid game, granting him Max Movement Speed towards his target with only 1 point in the ability, while no longer having the damage scale.



Lodestone
- Lodestoneâ€™s uniqueness of armor penetration was restricted to a single burst from his ultimate, and his intended role as a tank was often bypassed in favor of simply picking up a Portal Key and jumping into fights at the last second of Shatterstorm. To enhance his unique trait and remedy his battle aversion, he has been given more tools to stay alive as the fight occurs, both shielding himself and reducing the damage output of enemy heroes.



Lord Salforis
- Lord Salforis serves a very important niche in the game, mitigating the ability of enemies to heal and countering heroes who rely on Health Regeneration. However, the range on his spells didnâ€™t seem consistent with his desire to be up close and personal with Dark Lordâ€™s Presence. He has received some adjustments to his spells to make them more potent if Salforis can stick to his target, as well as adding a little more counterplay for the enemy if they can evade the Baron of Blackwal.



Magebane
- Magebane is a relatively simple and old-school hero who requires a lot of time to become a carry and often has to step into the middle of action for prolonged periods of time. To help push Magebane into the realm heroes who lean more towards our tank carries than squishy ones and emphasize his resistance to casters, Master of the Mantraâ€™s defense against Magic Damage has increased.



Magmus
- Magmus is another fan favorite and will always be drafted due to the flexibility and power his kit provides.



Monkey King
- Monkey King is a popular hero in all regions of play, but his kit allowed him to snowball a little too well and made him more powerful than the semi-carry he was intended to be, so Illusive Dash was changed to no longer scale with his Attack Damage. Monkey Kingâ€™s power is clearly more notable in the early and mid game, but tapers off late-game as intended.



Myrmidon
- Myrmidon has received some small changes to his kit, both increasing their quality of life and granting more counterplay options to his enemies. Forced Evolution now scales the Health given based on Myrmidonâ€™s Intelligence, giving his main attribute and support items relevancy in both forms, and the Crowd Control effects on Weed Field and Magic Carp have been swapped, giving enemies more of a choice than â€œstunnedâ€ or â€œstunned.â€

Nymphora
- Nymphora covers all the basics of support with Crowd Control, Mana Regeneration, and Healing, but none of this was relevant to her ultimate. In order to limit the number of global ganking spells in the game and focus Nymphora around the use of her highly effective support tools, she has been given an ultimate more centralized to her play-style, which allows her to recast her abilities and help her teammates with their own spells.



Ophelia
- Ophelia remains the definition of a high skillcap hero, capable of pushing down lanes and ganking through the use of her Commanded neutrals. Her ultimate providing a teamwide, global, and instant heal is still intact, making her one of the few heroes who can help save an ally from across the map.



Parallax
- Parallax is still a strong counter to enemy heroes with small manapools, but Earthshatter has been made more impactful by turning it into a burst tool rather than a damage over time ability. This forces the Parallax player to be more cautious about when to use the ability, but also feels much more satisfying than having to wait for an enemy to slowly melt in its presence.



Pearl
- Pearl had some massive overlap with Rhapsody because of her role as a support and her ultimate providing all-around damage mitigation. To give her a more unique identity in the pool, Preservation is now a strictly Magic Damage reducing tool, and is more effective at early levels, when Magic Damage is the most lethal. She is also currently the only hero with an ally purge, making her a great counter to heroes with strong debuffs.



Pebbles
- Pebbles has the unique benefit of heavily controlling the gameâ€™s tempo after obtaining his initiation tool, mainly because of the high lethality of landing his combo on a cooldown that is much shorter than most ultimate abilities. His power level has been increased to coexist with other PBT heroes.



Pestilence
- Pestilence already had a simple kit with a lot of draftability, but his reliance on Portal Key meant he couldnâ€™t spend his income on items that assist his carry potential until the game had already progressed. For this reason, Flight was given a secondary activation that allows him to quickly fly to his intended location, setting him up for Impale much easier than before.



Pharaoh
- Pharaoh has remained largely the same, but his power level has been increased to stay relevant in PBT. He will remain the premiere long-range initiator and isolationist, able to lockdown enemies for an extended duration within his Mummy Walls.



Plague Rider
- Plague Rider still boasts superior lane control through Extinguish and has remained largely the same. His ultimate is now amazingly devastating as a damage tool, but the CC has been removed; to get maximum benefit from Plague Carrier, he is better off relying on the utility provided by Earthblight.



Pollywog Priest
- Both Pollywog Priest and Witch Slayer had the same transfigure ability: Witch Slayer needed it and Pollywog Priest didnâ€™t. Morph has been replaced with a new ability that provides Stealth, allowing him to maximize the duration of Tongue Tied without the need of a Shrunken Head.



Predator
- Predator is a simple, classic hero that used to have two things going for him. The first was that he provided Magic Immunity and the second was his role as an anti-tank auto-attacker. His uniqueness as the only Magic Immune hero in the game still exists as a powerful counter to Magic Damage heroes, but Carnivorous has been changed so that he no longer overlaps with other heroes in the same role.



Prophet
- Prophet had some role confusion, as well as a rather frustrating ability in Persecution, that needed to be addressed. To help differentiate him in both feel and mechanics from other heroes who attacked in an area (like Hammerstorm and Forsaken Archer), his playstyle has shifted from an auto-attacker to more of a sustained damage caster, constantly slowing the movement and amplifying the damage enemies take so his own team to capitalize on the debuffs. He has also gained a new ability that makes his bird aesthetic more relevant to his design.



Pyromancer
- Pyromancer has been very fun, but very generic, for a long time, with little reason to be picked up beyond some push and semi-carry potential. His Blazing Strike has been updated with the unique capacity to instantly destroy illusions and deal significant damage to minions in its path, giving him some more depth and offering a counter to heroes who buy Geometerâ€™s Bane or rely on multiple units for their damage.



Rally
- Rally is generally considered a fun hero with a generic skillset, and his name never quite made sense with his design. To keep this fun playstyle while adding something new and draftable to his kit, Rally now has the ability to summon his allies from anywhere on the map to his location and grant them the benefits of some powerful auras. This offers a plethora of new strategies to the game, allowing Rally to become the commander he was always meant to be.



Rampage
- Rampage has been one of the more frustrating heroes to deal with in HoNâ€™s history, capable of showing up out of nowhere and stun-locking his enemies until they died. He also suffered from an overly-thematic approach to his design that pushed enemies away, despite his mechanical desire to be right next to them. Some tweaks have been made to solve both of these issues while retaining what made his abilities fun, as well as his role as a global ganker constantly observing the map for his next target.



Ravenor
- Ravenor has been pushed closer to a late game carry than a mid game snowballer. His early damage output has been lowered while giving him more scalability in the late game to help facilitate this. His uniqueness as a Magic Damage auto-attacker remains the same, making him a strong counter to heroes with high Armor or Physical Damage reduction.



Rhapsody
- Rhapsody brought a fair amount of frustration to the game between her successive mini-stuns from Staccato and her teamwide invulnerability from Protective Melody. By focusing her new kit around the massive area heal that Disco Inferno provides, she now has a higher skill cap and is much easier to counter in the long run.



Sand Wraith
- Sand Wraith was recently reworked to the standards of PBT so he hasnâ€™t seen many changes. He is still a solid counter to single target DPS and also provides a global initiation strategy.



Scout
- Scoutâ€™s kit was overloaded with a large amount of utility and scaling, more than any hero should ever have, making him a little too good at everything. Silence, vision, Stealth, detection, Movement Speed, Attack Speed, Max HP execution, Disarm, and Critical Strike. Phew! A lot of the excess utility in his kit has been removed, allowing him focus on a unique trait of boss control. Scout is able to take on the Golem bosses early and use his Electric Eyes to watch out for incoming enemies while doing so.



Solstice
- Solstice has not received many changes. Her kit makes her item builds and draftability flexible for most situations, even if she is not jungling from level 1. Pure Light has been given a little more flavor by providing a Miss Chance in Day form, aiding in counter-initiation and preventing some auto-attack damage to her team while they regroup.



Soulstealer
- Soulstealer is another classic hero that did not receive many changes, as his power has always been dependent on his performance in the early game, as well as how skillful the player is with the usage of his Demon Hands.



Succubus
- Succubus retains her draftability in Cursed Embrace, locking down enemy heroes through Shrunken Head, and Mesmerize, setting up easy skillshots for her team or simply removing a hero from the fight for a duration. However, very few players were making use of Smitten, as it was another single-target ability to click and didnâ€™t do much to most heroes compared to her other single-target abilities. Her new passive version of Smitten is now more useful and less frustrating to deal with on both ends, as it grants her personal protection against Physical Damage for a short duration.



Tempest
- Tempestâ€™s Meteor was not being utilized properly because the timing it required after a blink often made players forgo casting it in favor of simply landing an Elemental Void. Additionally, Tempestâ€™s item path was stagnant, as nearly every game was the same flowchart of Portal Key, Shrunken Head, and Restoration Stone. To help increase his combo potential and open his build path a little more, Meteor now has a blink attached to it.



Thunderbringer
- Thunderbringer was further pushed as a nuker that scales with enemy Health, and his ultimate was turned from a free damage tool that lacked counterplay into a skill-based spell that feels much better to hit. Because of his squishiness and overall lack of auto attacks, his cast ranges have been slightly increased so that he can compete as one of the best mid-laners in the game.



Torturer
- Torturer has received many quality-of-life changes and had various design issues fixed. His new passive, Binding Chains, grants him some Health Regeneration, allowing him to focus on building items that sustain his Mana pool instead of just items that increase his general Survivability. Now boasting a full suite of Physical Damage abilities, Torturer should see a lot of play time and good synergy with other physical damage lineups, as his abilities can bypass the protection offered by Shrunken Head.



Valkyrie
- Valkyrie needed very little change, as her kit is considered useful and enjoyable by most players. However, to better enforce Valkyrieâ€™s Prism as the ganking tool it was designed to be, rather than an escape or a hit-and-move buff, the ability is no longer global and now grants bonus damage when attacking out of stealth. A few quality of life changes have also been made to her Javelin of Light and Courageous Leap.



Voodoo Jester
- Voodoo Jester remains as a classic, offensive support hero that has near-guaranteed lethality on Cursed Ground if the afflicted targets are damaged sufficiently after its application. His power level has been slightly increased to stay on par with other PBT heroes.



Witch Slayer
- Witch Slayer has a ton of lock down and a great finisher, however, he has always just been a sort of mash-up of Pyromancer and Pollywog Priest. To give him a better reason for being picked up, Witch Slayer now has a late game mana burn tool, excellent for countering heroes like Parallax who thrive off of their large mana pools.



Wretched Hag
- Wretched Hag is one of the baseline nukers and an old standby for many HoN players, offering a very solid and satisfying kit that fits well into most lineups. To keep her relevant in PBT, Bat Blast now deals True Damage in a large conic area, giving her more usefulness as the game progresses and as enemies buy Magic Armor. Her Haunt has also been redesigned to push her more into the hybrid caster/autoattacker niche, granting her Attack Speed against anyone affected by Haunt.





= Hero Pool Details (PBT) =





Notes:

Magic Armor has been set to 5 for all heroes.
Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy have also been removed from the game for now to ensure testing stability.
All Hero Skill Icons that are recoloured indicates that they have been reworked/changed to an extent where it's different enough from retail to warrant players to read the ability tooltips again.


Due to major differences between hero abilities in PBT and retail, the Guides page has been temporarily disabled for PBT until further notice. This encourages players to figure out the best skill build routes depending on the current context instead of doing the same skill build they have always been doing on retail for some heroes.

== Item Pool (PBT Only) ==

 

+ The item pool has been revamped to give each item more of a unique purpose in the game, and to allow each class of heroes to have similar options when countering particular strategies or problematic heroes on the opposing team. Certain items' price points have been adjusted to facilitate buying items for this purpose.



+ Due to major differences between the item pool in PBT and retail, the Guides page has been temporarily disabled for PBT until further notice. This encourages players to try out new items instead of picking up the same items they did before, simply because some items may have received a significant change in their effects or their components in the item recipe.







+ Summary of Notable Changes (PBT Only) +

 

= Most Notable Changes (PBT Only) =

 

Portal Key (Removed)

- Portal Key is no longer in the item pool, as it caused a fundamental problem with heroes who depend on it to be massively successful in the game due to its incredible range and instant teleportation, not allowing for much counterplay or reaction time. It also created a design problem for heroes with skillshots, enabling them to blink onto a target and unleash all of their spells at once, even if they were designed to be used from afar, making initiation & approaches to situations one-dimensional.
- A few heroes who were dependent on Portal Key to initiate have had mobility tools added to their kit.

 

Tablet of Command (Changed)
- As a compromise, Tablet of Command received a slight mechanical change that allows the user to target a location and travel there (in addition to its ally pushing mechanics). It is slightly slower (non-instant) and has a lower cast range than Portal Key, but it has a better buildup and still be used as a supportive tool to save allies.



Shrunken Head (Changed)
- Shrunken Head's main purpose is to prevent Crowd Control on yourself (primarily for carries) so that you can cast your spells, attack heroes, and fulfill your purpose in a teamfight. However, it had a design issue where it rendered most of the cast obsolete, since the target cannot receive any Magic Damage while under its effects.
- By changing Shrunken Head's mechanics to primarily provide Crowd Control Immunity and limiting the amount of Magic Damage it can reduce, Shrunken Head's price point can be lowered so that carries can participate in teamfights & ganks sooner.
- Shrunken Head provides tapering Magic Armor when activated, allowing enemy heroes to still be able to deal Magic Damage to them (and more Magic Damage once the effect starts to taper off more).

 

Tome of Elements (New)

- Tome of Elements grants underleveled heroes on your team (typically Support heroes) a burst of Experience, allowing them to quickly catch up to the game's tempo, rather than becoming underleveled throughout the entire game.
*Tome of Elements has little to no benefits for carry or ganker class heroes if they are close to/above their team's average Experience, as the item adds bonus Experience based on the difference between your Experience and your team's average Experience if your Experience is the lower value.

 



 

= Evasion/True Strike related changes (PBT Only) =



 

Snake Bracelet (Removed)

 

- This item was not valued much for its Evasion and had limited buildup paths. The addition of Evasion into too many items was not desired because it would have added excessive ubiquitous utility to multiple items.
- Evasion and Miss Chance is now primarily implemented into the kit of a few heroes.

 

Halberd (Changed)
- As a countermeasure to the addition of Evasion to multiple heroes, Halberd is now a cheap item to partially counter Evasion, as well as building up into Savage Mace for a harder counter against Evasion.



 



= New Items (PBT Only) =



Arcane Bomb (New)

- Arcane Bomb is an early game pickup to deal with enemy illusions and player-controlled non-hero units.
- Enemy illusions have a problem of cluttering the screen and making single-target spells & autoattacks much more cumbersome to execute. Arcane Bomb facilitates eliminating this clutter in a pinch.



Armor of the Mad Mage (New)
- Armor of the Mad Mage is an item for heroes that wish to pick up Armor, while simultaneously increasing the effectiveness of Magic Damage for themselves and their allies.



Dreamcatcher (New)
- Dreamcatcher is an upgrade to Soultrap, and is used to increase the target's amount of Healing received and reduce an enemy's amount of Healing received.

 

 

Faux Bow (New)
- Faux Bow increases the Attack Range of Ranged Heroes and allows them to have a method of finishing off fleeing targets that escape their Attack Range.

 

Midnight Morning Star (New)
- Midnight Morning Star provides heroes bonus Strength and a Disarm effect, which allows them to counter autoattack-oriented carries.



 

Spectral Owl (New)

 

- Spectral Owl summons a bird to allow for mobile vision & scouting, as well as facilitating counterwarding by granting vision uphill of your Ward of Revelation.

 

 

Staff of the Goddess (New)
- Staff of the Goddess provides extra Intelligence and survivability via its self-purge effect for heroes who depend on momentum within a teamfight to continuously excel at their role.

 

 

 

Ultor's Heavy Helm (New)
- Ultor's Heavy Helm is intended to be the analog to Barrier Idol for Physical Damage. It provides a large amount of Block to protect your team from Physical autoattacks.

 



 

Twin Blades (New)

 

- Twin Blades is an item that is intended for melee heroes with high Attack Damage (but low or moderate Attack Speed) to maximize their upfront burst potential.



 

Wind Whistle (New)
- Wind Whistle was introduced to allow for cheaper sources of Movement Speed for support/caster-oriented heroes since it has poor slot efficiency & only builds up into items that generally favour these classes of heroes.

 








= Other items that were significantly changed (PBT Only) =



 

Behemoth's Heart (Changed)

 

- Behemoth's Heart and Mock of Brilliance's damage aura have been combined into 1 item, allowing heroes who want to be in the frontlines to constantly be a threat while simultaneously receiving a high amount of Health for survivability.

 

Frostfield Plate (Changed)

- Frostfield Plate has been changed to also grant Strength (and as a result, Max Health) to heroes that wish to pick up Armor, while simultaneously crippling enemy heroes that are dependent on Attack Speed.



Grave Locket (Changed)
- Grave Locket was remade to prevent your support heroes from being too underleveled throughout the game by granting them proximity experience even while they are dead, since support heroes typically have the most deaths in a game.
- Grave Locket is assembled from Orb of Zamos, making it a natural upgrade path for any support hero.



Grimoire of Power (Changed)
- Grimoire of Power has been retailored for heroes that need survivability from Magic Lifesteal, while also favouring heroes that benefit largely from Ability Cooldown Reduction.



Null Stone (Changed)
- Heroes who pick up this item now have the option to transfer the Spell Negation effect to another ally hero!

 

Jade Spire (Changed)
- Jade Spire is a cheap item that increases your Healing output, making it ideal for heroes who wish to maximize their team's survivability.



Kuldra's Sheepstick (Changed)
- Kuldra's Sheepstick's active effect was simply a universally improved version of Hellflower's aspect. Thus, it now builds up from Hellflower.



Plated Greaves (Changed)
- Plated Greaves was adjusted to be more oriented towards selfish survivability against Physical autoattacks, as its previous effects were negligible when used for your team or yourself.

 

Riftshards (Changed)
- When fully upgraded, deals a portion of the target's Max Health as bonus damage. This allows autoattack-oriented carries to deal with heroes that have a high Health pool.



Shieldbreaker (Changed)

- Shieldbreaker had a historical problem of being misunderstood as an item that counters Armor. In reality, it was picked up to increase the snowballing power of heroes that deal a high burst of Physical Damage early to mid game (due to how Armor mechanics function).
- Shieldbreaker now requires multiple autoattacks to remove a larger percentage of Armor. This minimizes its use on burst-heavy Physical Damage, as you need to attack them multiple times before Shieldbreaker's Armor shredding effects are pronounced, while also maximizing its intended purpose (to remove Armor regardless of how much your target has).



 

Stormspirit (Changed)

 

- Stormspirit has been adjusted to only target yourself and enemies.
- Other items are designed to save allies, and thus Stormspirit was reoriented to be more of an offensive setup tool, while still retaining its defensive usage for only yourself.



Symbol of Rage (Changed)
- Symbol of Rage is now built from Elder Parasite and acts as an improved version of it in terms of the Lifesteal granted while autoattacking.





= Other Removed Items (PBT Only) =



+ The following items are removed since they had a low pickup rate, and were only used to build into mid tier items:

- Fortified Bracer
- Soulscream Ring
- Amulet of Exile
- Perpetual Cogwheel
- Voltstone



- Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy are removed for now to ensure testing stability.

- Nome's Wisdom is removed because its impact is relatively low, and the Lightbrand line and Jade Spire now fulfill the survivability/heal functionality better than Nome's Wisdom can.

- Sol's Bulwark was an all-encompassing item for pushers and snowball-oriented burst Physical Damage semi-carries early game that also upgraded into a fantastic late-game item (Daemonic Breastplate).

- Sacrificial Stone's experience-while-dead effects are now integrated into the new Grave Locket.

- Ultor's Heavy Plate has been essentially changed into Ultor's Heavy Helm (since the new item upgrades from Helm of the Black Legion).

- Shield of the Five is removed from the game because its active effect had a low impact for most of the game.

- Spiked Bola is removed from the game because Agility heroes do not pick up this item due to a lack of survivability granted by this item.

- Mock of Brilliance's damage aura effect is now integrated into the new Behemoth's Heart.

- Bloodborne Maul is removed from the game because having Strength carry heroes becoming too prevalent basically allows them to completely replace a late-game Agility carry.

- Harkon's Blade is removed from the game because Shieldbreaker is performing its main function (to bypass large amounts of Armor).

- Whispering Helm is temporarily removed from the game since its main purpose was to dominate additional minions to use in push-oriented lineups, and to build into Symbol of Rage.
*Symbol of Rage has a new buildup, so Whispering Helm is no longer necessary for that purpose.

*Cooldown: 22 seconds
- Active: Makes target enemy hero or self-stunned, restrained and invulnerable for 2.5 seconds. After the duration, the target is Perplexed and Restrained for another second.
- After the initial Cycloned effect expires, the target cannot be affected by Stormspirit again for the next 2.5 seconds.

 

+ Stormspirit has been adjusted to only target yourself and enemies.
+ Other items are designed to save allies, and thus Stormspirit was reoriented to be more of an offensive setup tool, while still retaining its defensive usage for only yourself.

 

Tablet of Command

- Recipe: Sustainer (1600) + Wind Whistle (200) + Recipe (700) = 2500 Gold Total
- Grants: +6 Health Regeneration, 100% Mana Regeneration, +20 Movement Speed.

*Cooldown: 25 seconds

- Target a position to quickly travel there.
- Target an ally hero to Push them 600 units in the direction they are facing.
*Destroys trees within 100 radius of the target while it is being pushed.

 

+ Portal Key is no longer in the item pool, as it caused a fundamental problem with heroes who depend on it to be massively successful in the game. It also created a design problem where heroes typically use Portal Key to blink in and unleash all their skillshots, even if they were designed to be used from afar, making initiation & approaches to situations one-dimensional.
+ Rather than keep Portal Key in the game, the majority of heroes who are dependent on Portal Key have had mobility added to their kit to emulate the function of Portal Key to a good enough extent such that they do not require it to be picked up.
+ As a compromise, Tablet of Command still retains Portal Key's general functionality. It is slightly slower (non-instant) and has a lower cast range than Portal Key, but it has a better buildup and still be used as a supportive tool to save allies.

- Grants: +20 Strength, +500 Max Health.

+ Frostfield Plate is tailored for initiators that need an extra spell instance to keep enemies near them just a little longer, while protecting the followup by their allies from autoattacks.

+ Genjuro did not need the Movement Speed Slow on attack, as the main reason for obtaining this item is to provide your character with 2 Stealth instances in combat.

 

Helm of the Black Legion

- Beastheart (1000) + Lifetube (800) + Iron Buckler (225) = 2025 Gold Total
- Grants: +250 Max Health, +6 Health Regen.
- Passively grants a 50% chance to block 60 damage (30 for ranged). Does not work against gadgets.

 

+ Helm of the Black Legion was tapering off too quickly if you obtain this item early game. The increased Block value allows it to maintain its relevance slightly longer.
+ Its block mechanics were also reverted to its legacy form & had numbers adjusted to fit its intended purpose of being an early-mid game survivability item.

 

Icon of the Goddess

- Glowstone (1100) + Beastheart (1000) + Pickled Brain (900) = 3000 Gold Total
- Grants: +425 Max Health, +425 Max Mana, +2 Health Regen, +40% Mana Regen.

*Cooldown: 70 seconds
- Activate to dispel Debuffs on self, and then grant 100% Debuff, Stun and Mana Burn Reduction to self for 6 seconds.
*Also grants a tapering 25 Magic Armor upon activation.
*Channeled Crowd Control still bypasses the 100% Debuff and Stun Reduction.
*Has an Activation Modifier. Using this item disables other items with this modifier for the duration.

 

+ Shrunken Head's main purpose is to prevent Crowd Control on yourself (primarily for carries) so that you can cast your spells, attack heroes, and fulfill your purpose in a teamfight. However, it had a design issue where it rendered most of the cast obsolete, since the target cannot receive any Magic Damage while under its effects.
+ By changing Shrunken Head's mechanics to primarily provide Crowd Control Immunity and limiting the amount of Magic Damage it can reduce, Shrunken Head's price point can be lowered so that carries can participate in teamfights & ganks sooner.
+ Shrunken Head provides tapering Magic Armor when activated, allowing enemy heroes to still be able to deal Magic Damage to them (and more Magic Damage once the effect starts to taper off more).

- Heavy Plated: 100% chance to block 70 damage.

*Mana Cost: 0
*Cooldown: 45 seconds.

 

+ Ultor's Heavy Helm is intended to be the analog to Barrier Idol for Physical Damage. It provides a large amount of Block to protect your team from Physical autoattacks.

- Grants: +6 Strength, +6 Agility, +6 Intelligence.

*Has an Activation Modifier. Using this item disables other items with this modifier for the duration.

*Mana Cost: 75
*Cooldown: 30 seconds.

 

+ Since Harkon's Blade is no longer in the game, Void Talisman is not realistically counterable. Void Talisman is still an effective counter against Physical autoattackers, but now Physical autoattackers can still feel like their autoattacks do something when hitting someone with a Void Talisman.

- Grants: +8 Strength, +8 Agility, +8 Intelligence, +10 Damage, +150 Attack Range (Ranged Only).
*Bonus Attack Range does not stack.

*Range = Your Attack Range
*Mana Cost: 50

- Grants: +6 Intelligence, +10 Damage, +40 Attack Speed, +80% Mana Regeneration
*Range: 800
*Mana Cost: 100
*Cooldown: 20 seconds
- Active: Silences target for 3.5 seconds and increases their damage taken by 15%. Target also leaves behind a visible trail.

 

+ Hellflower received a price reduction along with a small reduction in its effects so that its Silencing effect can be picked up earlier in the game.
+ Hellflower also builds into Kuldra's Sheepstick now, as Kuldra's Sheepstick is a universally improved version of Hellflower's active effect.

 

Hypercrown

- Recipe: 2x Warpcleft (1500) + Recipe (400) = 3400 Gold Total
- Grants: +120 Attack Speed.

- Broadsword (1200) + Punchdagger (450) + Recipe (1050) = 2700 Gold Total (3750/4800/5850 Gold Total for levels 2/3/4 of this item)
*Can be upgraded 3 times.

- On level 4 of this item, the critical strike also deals 8% of the target's Max Health as bonus damage.

 

+ Heroes that obtain too much survivability are often difficult to deal with. The max level of Riftshards is expensive to obtain, but allows autoattack-oriented carries to deal with heroes that have a high Health pool.

- Grants: +35 Attack Damage, +35 Attack Speed.
- On attack, applies a stack of Broken Armor to target for 3 seconds, reducing their Max Armor by 15% per charge.
*Max of 6 charges.

 

+ Shieldbreaker had a historical problem of being misunderstood as an item that counters Armor. In reality, it was picked up to increase the snowballing power of heroes that deal a high burst of Physical Damage early to mid game (due to how Armor mechanics function).
+ Shieldbreaker's main use now is for autoattack heroes to remove a percentage of Armor through sustained damage from autoattacks. This minimizes its use on burst-heavy Physical Damage, as you need to attack them multiple times before Shieldbreaker's Armor shredding effects are pronounced.

 

Symbol of Rage

- Recipe: Slayer (2000) + Elder Parasite (2000) + Recipe (1000) = 5000 Gold Total
- Grants: +40 Damage, +30 Attack Speed, +25% Lifesteal.

New Forsaken Archer Avatar: Yumi
- The legendary annual Shao Temple archery competition is a joyful event that brings villagers together from throughout the Sang-La Mountains and allows the monks to share food, tea, and news from the lands beyond the mountains. Yumi has been dominating the event as the first -- and only -- female kyudoka since she was a small girl, for her natural abilities with the bow quickly surpassed those of her instructor, then her kyudojo, until the Shao Temple became the only place that could harness her true potential. The monks taught her the way of shin-zen-bi, to shoot with truth, goodness, and beauty, so that when she uses her bow and arrow with a good and virtuous spirit toward all things, her archery will become naturally beautiful and true. Skeptical at first, Yumi finally embraced this training and grew to understand its power, and her already amazing skills became unbelievable.

Because of the beauty and virtue integral to her archery, she was stunned when the monks first told her it could be used as a weapon. But when they told her of the atrocities happening outside the walls of the temple, of the Hellbourne and their soulless cruelty, she realized the virtuous path was leading her straight into battle with these daemons. Every raise, draw, and release had prepared her for this, and she and her bow would share the beauty of her kyudo with these corrupted fiends one arrow at a time.

New Night Hound Avatar: Wildcat
- The cruelly playful Lynx Tribe of Death's Cradle is infamous for stalking and chasing their victims before pouncing and toying with them, finally ending their misery only after the entertainment becomes tedious. When they ambushed a gypsy caravan and systematically slaughtered everyone aboard, the last thing they expected to find when they commenced the looting was a sleeping infant, swaddled in blankets. Even the Lynx are not that heartless (usually), so they took the orphan into their fold and trained her in the ways of the feline huntress. The girl took to it like a cat to catnip, and embraced the traditions and tactics so fully she went to great lengths to change her appearance to something closer to her fellow huntresses. She may still look somewhat human, but when the claws come out, she is all Lynx.



New Parallax Avatar: Cruxlord
- The Cruxlords are an extraterrestrial race even more ancient than the Artificers. They seek the ancient, powerful objects held most secret throughout the universe, for within those items are the answers to unlocking even more power. Though Andromeda's memory is still incomplete, she senses that the Cruxlords may have harvested the original dark matter and created the Fulcrums that became the devastating weapon of the Artificers, sending them forth to destroy entire planets and scatter the debris into space. Scanning the dross for ancient relics is much easier than searching intact worlds and dealing with their tedious inhabitants, but this Newerth has proven more resilient than any other planet, and now the Cruxlords must descend upon it and handle things themselves.

= New Hero: Chi =



Chi, the Exiled Master, was once a beloved brother to Warchief. Chi's embrace of meditation and non-violence caused him to be cast out from the Red Sand tribe, and in exile his meditative abilities became so advanced he no longer needed to use his body, for his spirit could manipulate the world around him. He was locked in a deep meditative state when Adrenaline and Apex's army massacred the entire Red Sand tribe and possessed Warchief, and it was in the spirit realm -- once scorned by Warchief -- where Chi battled the corruption and kept it from completely claiming his brother. 

As Warchief's energy returned to normal, then beyond, Chi realized his brother was preparing himself for something epic: Battle. War.

And his own death, if that's what it took to vanquish the enemy who slaughtered the Red Sand tribe.

Chi expected to be conflicted -- should he abandon his beliefs completely, join the violence and chaos of the human world to save his brother?

But he felt no discord.

He was completely at peace with it.

For now he knew, energy was energy. It could be used to soothe, heal, and create, or to kill and destroy.

If his brother's enemies chose to use their energy to harm others, Chi would simply turn it back on them.

It would be their efforts that brought their demise, not his.

Now, still physically weak and seeking to enlighten others and soothe their rage with meditation, he and his spirit animal Soto join Warchief and the Legion in a last effort to bring peace to Newerth.

= Chi, the Exiled Master =



+ For centuries, the monks of the Sang-La Mountains have formed a physical and spiritual wall between Newerth and the forces of corruption that seep from the bottomless crevices and pits into All Hells. These portals existed long before the Second Corruption, allowing the Hellbourne to probe, infiltrate, and terrorize the landscape as they prepared for the uprising. Because of this, the monks have had ample â€“ more than enough, they would say â€“ time to develop powerful ways to counter and destroy the daemonic invaders.



New Chi Early Access Avatar: Osho
- Osho, also called "The Old Teacher" by his students (along with slightly less-honorific titles behind his back) is the eldest instructor among the Sang-La monks and the most experienced when it comes to battling evil corruption. The Hellbourne and their capacity for chaos have ceased to surprise him, and some days he simply can't even muster the energy to be interested in the daemons he's sending back to All Hells. The only thing that does manage to raise one of his bushy white eyebrows is when a student of The Way does not act like a totally idiotic buffoon in training, tripping over their own clumsy feet and stammering like a newborn chiprel. Only his beloved cat Osho truly understands, for his ability to remain aloof among morons is beyond even Master Osho's.



New Chi Avatar: Master Ka
- Master Ka uses his pure spirit and the vast, empty void of his meditation to absorb the corrupted flames of the Hellbourne, cleanse them of impurities and malice, and return them to the source with a righteous intensity that destroys that which seeks to destroy. He is a scorching mirror for the unholy, literally fighting fire with fire to keep the Hellbourne at bay and purge their corruption from Newerth. Most think his companion Huo is simply a pet monkey, but the clever creature wields a powerful void himself and serves as a force multiplier when Master Ka faces an overwhelming level of corruption.



= F.L.E.X. =



+ The F.L.E.X. soldiers are the most advanced -- and experimental -- weapons developed by the Legion's war machine yet. Created by a top-secret program buried so deeply in the Corps of Engineers that not even Tork knew about it, they are bionic, armored suits powered by artificial intelligence that only utilize the best traits of the heroes upon which they are based and ignore such things as doubt and fear. While each F.L.E.X. soldier has complete agency over how they perform their duties, they are all programmed to follow a specific sequence of orders once the enemy is involved: Find > Lock-on > Engage > eXterminate. It is a lethal form of evolved intelligence that always creates a predictable outcome: when a F.L.E.X. soldier targets an enemy, one of them is going to die.



New F.L.E.X. Behemoth Avatar: F.L.E.X. Behemoth
- The F.L.E.X. artificial intelligence is programmed to ignore traits and tendencies that are likely to cause doubt and hesitation in battle, and compassion falls within this category. However, the F.L.E.X. Behemoth AI quickly realized that compassion was one of the Legion hero's strongest attributes and could be amplified to increase its battlefield efficacy. By shifting the Find > Lock-on > Engage > eXterminate directives to focus on the fear of Legion allies rather than the aggression of Hellbourne enemies, F.L.E.X. Behemoth is able to place itself in prime positions for intercepting attacks and obliterating the incoming threat. Countless grateful -- and unscathed -- Legion warriors are grateful for this powerful emotional intelligence.



New F.L.E.X. Hammerstorm Avatar: F.L.E.X. Hammerstorm
- F.L.E.X. Hammerstorm may not seem that different from the original source material at first glance, for the famed warrior is known for his strength and dedication to the cause, traits executed perfectly by the F.L.E.X. artificial intelligence. But a closer look reveals that F.L.E.X. Hammerstorm has discovered a weapon untapped by the Legion legend: personality. It turns out that while pure brute force is indeed effective, stronger alliances can be formed by being likable, friendly, and humorous, and enemies can be rendered off-balance by unexpected jokes, flirtations, and oversharing. The fact that all of this makes the original Hammerstorm very uncomfortable is proof that it works.

New Swiftblade Avatar: Deathbloom
- The Cleansing Research Labs inside the Electrician's Laboratory are hidden deep within the sublevels to ensure a properly controlled environment, and to keep his most extreme experiments from prying eyes -- Legion spies as well as curious Hellbourne who, despite dwelling among the damned for millennia, may still find his cutting edge work unsettling. The Electrician developed the Cleansing procedure after discovering the power of corruption was greatly reduced when it had to contend for control of a being, battling against the soul and whatever divine power reinforced it. So he found a way to scrape the soul from a living creature, harvest it, and replace it with an artificial form of corruption that is much more controllable than the hellish, chaotic version. And much more powerful.

Deathbloom is his first success, technically, as she was the first human to survive the procedure and still be able to function despite the artificial corruption trying to burst free from its human vessel. Captured by his Shocktroopers from a lightly-guarded supply caravan, the young patient had tremendous skills in cleaning, food preparation, and little else. The Cleansing enhanced these talents into incredibly effective combat skills, but what the Electrician did not expect was the augmentation of her ingrained desire to help people. Such a flaw should have been scrubbed along with her soul, but apparently it was embraced by every cell of her being, even her DNA. Deathbloom was supposed to be his first Cleansed Warrior, but instead she became a vile traitor, slashing her way out of the sublevels and wreaking havoc throughout Laboratory as she pursued her new mission to do some cleansing of her own -- wiping Newerth clean of Hellbourne.


New Voodoo Jester Avatar: Painkiller
- Painkiller serves joyfully as the head nurse within the Electrician's Cleansing Research Labs, prepping victims -- er, patients -- for their procedures and making sure the brilliant Electrician has everything he needs to conduct his best work. Unruly patients quickly turn docile when she gives them a heavy dose of her sedative cocktail, which overwhelms the pain receptors with so much agony they are unable to move, let alone fight. Even the Shocktroopers standing guard outside the Cleansing labs know to keep silent, lest they disturb the Electrician and earn a dose of Painkiller themselves.

She would be happy to never leave the nightmarish sublevels of Laboratory, but the escape of Deathbloom has caused her beloved Electrician so much angst it's causing his work to suffer, and he's losing more Cleansing patients than he's saving. Well, this just won't do. Painkiller has made it her mission to hunt Deathbloom down and drag her back for another Cleansing, and if that one doesn't take, the last thing that traitor will see is the ultimate painkiller needle slipping into her heart.

New Goldenveil Songkran Avatar: Songkran Goldenveil
- When it comes to bringing the most powerful water arsenal to the Songkran festival, most partygoers opt for bigger water cannons, heavier buckets, and longer hoses. But they're missing the most obvious solution: more arms. Not armaments -- literally arms. Songkran Goldenveil can toss twice as many water balloons and dump four buckets of water for every deuce from a mere two-handed reveler, and her Songkran poncho doesn't just provide shelter from the soakings -- it also creates the perfect party camouflage, enabling her to perform a flawless perch & plunge into the soaking fray!

 

New Lord Salforis Songkran Avatar: Songkran Salforis
- Songkran Salforis takes his water festival activities very seriously, packing a full arsenal of water weapons and floaties and adding new ink to his gorgeous water-themed tattoos before each New Year. The tradition he truly embraces is the honoring of his ancestors, and while some carry this out by offering sand to temples for repair or releasing animals as a requiem, Songkran Salforis takes it one step further -- he actually summons his deceased ancestors to join the celebration and help him drench the entire festival in cleansing waters. Everybody expects to get soaked at Songkran, but nobody expects to get soaked by a bunch of flying skulls and a creepy dead lady. Happy New Year!

 

New Pharaoh Songkran Avatar: Songkran Pharaoh
- Songkran is a festival of unity, merit-making, and the cleansing of sins and bad luck, but some unsavory characters use it as an excuse to add more sins and uncleanliness to their souls. When these types show up at a party, it's Songkran Pharaoh's honor to bounce them right back out with the help of his Songkran Security Team. His paddleboarder disguise allows him to blend in perfectly with the revelers, and the paddle makes an excellent gentle -- or not -- escort for those who don't want to leave the party willingly. If he ever feels outnumbered or in danger of a party slipping out of hand, one call to his Security Team creates a ring of cohorts ready to completely cleanse any gathering of buzzkills and troublemakers.

 

New Sir Benzington Songkran Avatar: Songkran Benzi
- Traffic is INSANE during the Songkran festival, and Songkran Benzi knows the only way to get to all of the best parties scattered across Newerth is to hop on his trusty Beavrel Bike and dash through the crowded streets. Of course, there's no reason not to soak everyone and everything between parties, so he's always ready with his splash lance and sidearm squirt gun, and when he encounters a target-rich environment that is just too tempting to pass up, he launches into an epic jump and cannonball splashes everyone in the vicinity. Yeah, it totally trashes his bike, but it's so worth it.

While each F.L.E.X. soldier has complete agency over how they perform their duties, they are all programmed to follow a specific sequence of orders once the enemy is involved: Find > Lock-on > Engage > eXterminate. It is a lethal form of evolved intelligence that always creates a predictable outcome: when a F.L.E.X. soldier targets an enemy, one of them is going to die.

 

New F.L.E.X. Flint Beastwood Avatar: F.L.E.X. Flint
- The Legion Corps of Engineers was initially baffled by the AI data they harvested from Flint Beastwood. (The data was sold to them by an entrepreneurial Merrick employee, who scanned and downloaded the information while Flint was passed out after a drinking contest with Balphagore.) The data showed no sign of doubt, fear, guilt, shame, or humility -- all of the things the F.L.E.X. soldiers are programmed to ignore -- which led the Engineers to believe they had an incomplete data set, but it turned out they had it all; Flint just doesn't possess any of those silly traits to begin with. This has made F.L.E.X. Flint the most efficient killer of the group, freeing up all of her processing power for locating and eliminating her targets, and she even has some left over for a bit of AI-fueled swagger.

 

New F.L.E.X. Bushwack Avatar: F.L.E.X. Bushwack
- F.L.E.X. Bushwack not only has a fatal set of combat skills, she also has a highly refined sense of irony. It was Bushwack's forbidden tampering with technology that got him exiled from his Rulian Marsh tribe and drove him into the clutches of the Electrician and Dr. Repulsor, and it will be the next level of technology that exterminates each and every one of them. Her AI has been programmed to focus on those three targets in order to cripple the Hellbourne's research and development capabilities. If she succeeds, she will be the ultimate force multiplier due to all of the Legion lives spared from the devastating technology of those madmen.

 

 

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

 

= User Interface (UI) =

- Notification sounds will now play when someone sends an Instant Message (IM) to you, or when you get invited to a group.
- "Remove All Notifications" button now properly clears notifications (instead of just 4-5 of them).
*Note that some System Messages are still not removable due to those messages having a different notification type in the legacy UI, and the merging process meant that the button does not clear this type of notification yet. This will be fixed in a future patch.
- Players can now properly random from their list of Favourite Heroes on the Hero Pick Screen.
- The bonuses that accumulate towards Silver Coin will no longer have their progress bars overflowing past their boundaries.
- Players can now properly claim their rewards from Hero Mastery.

- Region Selection preferences no longer resets after every game.

*General

*IM Received
- Other System Message Notification settings have had their default setting to only be displayed Out of Game & In History.
*These changes reduce the overall amount of clutter from System Message notifications.
- URSA Silver Coin Multiplier is now mentioned properly when its effects are applied.

 

= General =

 

- Some skills with strings that are too long for the Hero Pick Screen have been shortened.
*This means that unfortunately, some details in the Simple Tooltips had to be removed.

 

- Strings for abilities currently boosted by Staff of the Master will no longer redundantly say they have been boosted by Staff of the Master.
*Instead, the fact that they are boosted will be indicated by the ability name and the green tooltips in the ability description.

 

Forests of Caldavar
- The trees above the Legion pull camp can now be cut at melee range with proper pathing.
- A spot on the right edge of the map below Hellbourne's bottom lane entrance has been fixed so that units no longer get stuck if you cut trees there and attempt to walk there.

New Songkran Nomad Avatar: Songkran Nomad
- The fruit stand is a pretty boring (and sticky) place to work most of the year, and the owner's daughter has been counting the days until the Songkran Water Festival begins. Not only is it a chance to wash off the seemingly permanent fruit juices -- her father also promised she'd be allowed to go into the joyous crowds to sell their family specialty, the giant watermelon ice, and she's planning to use this as an opportunity to unveil her new watermelon-themed line of swimwear. Her father might be upset when he sees how much skin it covers (or doesn't), but hopefully he'll calm down when he sees how many watermelon ices she's sold.

* Also available with Thai voice

New HoNWorld Nomad Avatar: HoNWorld Nomad
- Some say the battle-hardened loner Nomad is obsessed with his mission to exterminate the Sand Wraiths -- and all of the Hellbourne -- should he live long enough. And it is true, the warrior shuns the comforts and companionship of Legion encampments, he has no friends among the ranks, and only bothers with conversation when necessary to establish the next mission. What his Legion comrades don't know is this obsession carries over to all things competitive, and with the epic Garena Star League fast approaching Nomad has turned his intense focus to one thing: creating a battlesuit that will dominate the event and make all other heroes look like the weak poseurs they truly are. Nomad isn't too familiar with technology, computers...or electricity for that matter...so he's going all-out and adding bleeding-edge components to his armor and weaponry to ensure superiority. (He also made sure the helmet would cover his face on the off-chance his trademark scowl cracked into a grin from having so much fun at the event.) Nomad has not given up the fight against the Sand Wraiths -- he never will -- but stacking up some victories at GSL will be a nice way to train for his next desert skirmish.

 

New HoNWorld Vindicator Avatar: HoNWorld Vindicator
- The Great Rift version of the Garena Star League event is much different than ours. There is a tiny slice of attention paid to eSports and gaming, but the vast majority of the event focuses on devouring other competitors face-first and spitting out their steaming bones. Last year's champion, HoNWorld Vindicator, doesn't see much challenge in simply eating more faces and skinning weak Rift pubs alive, so she's bringing her elite-level playbook to the portal and heading straight for our top GSL teams. Watch out gamers -- she may not know about our no face-eating rule.

New F.L.E.X. Silhouette Avatar: F.L.E.X. Silhouette
- F.L.E.X. Silhouette is everything the original Silhouette's Scout trainers wanted her to become -- stealthy, professional, and extremely lethal. Indeed, they are both excellent assassins, but F.L.E.X. Silhouette wisely chose to leave the boisterous attitude and cockiness of her source hero's personality out of the programming. Her A.I. may let some bravado slip through, just to examine the results, but other than that F.L.E.X. Silhouette is all about executing her core sequence, which always leads to executing her enemies.

 

New F.L.E.X. Legionnaire Avatar: F.L.E.X. Legionnaire
- Rather than rely on a single hero's intelligence to create its operational code, F.L.E.X. Legionnaire benefits from the experience, savvy, and courage of battalions of war-hardened soldiers. Every Legionnaire with more than five years in the ranks (survivability) and fifty Hellbourne kills (lethality) volunteered for the extraction process to help make F.L.E.X. Legionnaire the greatest possible force multiplier it could become. And though they've placed wagers on how long the newfangled thing will actually last in battle, they're grateful for every daemon it kills along the way.

 

New F.L.E.X. Set Effect
- Augment your entire F.L.E.X. set with unique, electrifying effects for each F.L.E.X. warrior!

New Blood Hunter Avatar: Hannya Blood Hunter
- The Widows of the Succubus are a miserable lot. They mourn the deaths of their husbands, lured to a passionate and agonizing death by the terrible seductress, and they mourn their marriage vows, apparently so tenuous that their spouses would rather risk death than defy the embrace of a daemon. Their simmering jealously was brought to the surface when the widows gathered to support each other, and rather than wail piteously and rage at the injustice of it all, they formed a plan. After some careful questions in the right back-alley alchemy shops, they journeyed to the Sang-La Mountains and found the withered old woman who knew how to summon the Hannya. A physical manifestation of the misery and jealousy of the Widows of the Succubus, the Hannya is the perfect weapon against that wretched temptress. He cannot be seduced, for he has no desire except to destroy those who foment jealousy.



When the Hannya was given the Succubus as his target, he rejoiced, for eliminating that daemon would lift an eternal, looming cloud of the toxic emotion from Newerth. Let the Succubus' final feeling be of overwhelming, crushing jealousy as she witnesses the true power of the Hannya!





New Glacius Avatar: Keybreaker
New Hammerstorm Avatar: Locksmasher
- Born to parents of the highest status within the cult of the Corrupted Disciples, the Latchkey sisters spent their childhood traveling across Newerth seeking powerful relics that had to be hidden from the Sacred Order of Arasunia, yet made readily accessible for when the proper time arrived. Ever cunning, their parents secreted the relics within everyday items and cast spells to make them invisible until the sorcery was unlocked. To their eldest daughter they gave the power of the lock; to the youngest went the power of the key, and the relic could not be released unless both sisters were present to serve their roles.



But when the proper time actually arrived, now known as the Second Corruption, the young Latchkey sister was appalled to see the relics they had protected being used as weapons, unleashed upon the innocent to cause devastation, slaughter, and heartbreak. Her older sister found this carnage amusing, even thrilling! The suffering and cursing of Sol's name was everything they and their parents had hoped for. She was so mesmerized by the delightful anguish she didn't notice her younger sister trying to use her powers to smash one of the magical locks until it was too late -- the little brat actually destroyed the lock and gave the relic to one of the foul Martyrs! So began the ongoing struggle between the sisters -- one trying to help the Legion and make up for the evil her parents carried out, one trying to bring victory to the Hellbourne and honor the vision her parents had for Newerth. Whenever they meet at the site of a prized relic, the sibling rivalry is epic!

New Blacksmith Avatar: Plinko Smith
- Plinko Smith has a bit of a gambling problem. He gambles on cards, dice, roulette, even which bubble in Engineer's beer stein will pop first. When he started taking pre-battle wagers on which enemy would die first, it became increasingly burdensome to keep track of who bet what, on which enemy, how they would die -- then throw in the actual chaos of battle and it was a real pain in the butt. When he lamented about this to Tork over a vat of beer, the Engineer devised a perfect solution: rather than rely on betting machines that had to be lugged around, why not become the actual machine? Measurements were taken, more beer was poured, tweaks were made, and viola! Plinko Smith strutted onto the battlefield, taking bets, paying out gold to the winners and bludgeoning the losers.

 

New Gladiator Avatar: Kusanagi Gladiator
- The young girl from the tiny Sang-La village was honored to work for the shinshoku, the priests who tended the Kusanagi Shrine, and she found great joy in sweeping and washing the floors, filling the lanterns, and preparing for ceremonies. When word came of General Po's rampage across the land, devastating sacred sites and converting them to shrines to himself, the priests began the heartbreaking process of dismantling the shrine to hide it from the brutal despot. But they were too late. Po's scouts arrived before the priests could fully conceal the shrine and its namesake, the legendary Kusanagi sword, revered for how many battles it had won. The terrified girl hid behind the sword's altar, powerless as the priests were slaughtered by Po's soldiers and put on display for when their master arrived. She prayed to the gods for help -- not to save her life, but to protect the sword and keep it from falling into the hands of evil. Perhaps she could take it from the altar, slip into the mountains and hide it until she could find someone who could truly protect the blade...

She lifted Kusanagi from its altar -- the blade was surprisingly light -- and crept toward the thick forest just beyond the shrine's clearing. When one of Po's scouts shouted at her, then charged with a half-dozen others, the girl knew she had failed. But she would not give up without a fight. The scouts laughed as she lifted the blade in an awkward warrior's stance, then taunted her, offering her one free shot before they threw her corpse atop the dead priests. With tears in her eyes the girl swung the blade, knowing it would fall short, but it was all she could think to do. The blade did miss, but the fiery wheel burning with the fury of the gods did not. The blade unleashed this magical weapon upon the scouts and cut them down, turning them to bones and ash. The remaining scouts attacked and she swung the blade again, summoning a shrine that trapped the killers within then collapsed upon them. The girl stared at Kusanagi, awed by its power. The legends were true! If she could master the blade, become worthy of carrying it into battle against General Po and the fiends of corruption, maybe she could help bring peace to the land. Maybe then Kusanagi could rest again, but for now, there was work to be done, and a legend to continue.

 

New Ravenor Avatar: Cyber Ravenor
- With Ascension technology fully integrated into life on Newerth, the battlefields and warriors who stand upon them will never be the same! While the extraterrestrial equipment was intended to destroy Parallax and the Artificers, the Legion has adapted it to further their cause against the daemon blight; and of course, corruption cares not what it taints, so even the pure technology of the Ascension is not immune to its destructive powers.

The Electrician constantly searches for new technologies and materials to aid his mission of replicating the destructive powers of the Hellbourne and expanding their damage capabilities, and when he discovered the Ascension technology and its seemingly endless depth of potential, he immediately began experiments to weaponize it. His first attempts to use the unfamiliar technology to channel his beloved electricity ended rather embarrassingly, with a scorched face and a laboratory that still smells like burnt bone marrow. But when he modeled his formulas after the ancient Daemon Lords, those cruel tormentors known as Ravenors, aha! Converting the electricity to plasma made it much more stable -- and lethal -- while imbuing the cybernetic soldiers with a sole directive of causing as much human suffering as possible gave them a simple, executable mission. The results, battlefields strewn with charred corpses forever locked in poses of agony, make the Electrician giddy with satisfaction.

New Fayde Avatar: Contessa Raze
- The Aritor family began as farmers of a small parcel, grew that to include vineyards, orchards, and livestock, and over the years became the largest producer of food for the Legion army. At a certain point, the family became more interested in politics and pageantry than soil and manure and relocated from their country estate to a manor within the walls of Adkarna where they flew their sigil -- a large, ornamental scythe -- for all to see. The family has always supported the Grimm name, from the brutal War of the Single Banner to the days when Lord Commander Grimm seemed to be losing his spine, and his mind, to the wretched Sylvia. When Maliken fled in madness and grief, the Aritors placed their confidence and money behind young Jeraziah to lead the way against those who opposed the Legion and Sol's magnificence. One thing they never offered, though, was blood. The Aritor family was much too precious to waste upon a filthy battlefield, but their gold helped train and equip many lower citizens so they could fight and die for the cause.

 

This is why, when the young Aritor contessa demanded enrollment in Adkarna's combat school, her parents shook their heads and obliged, knowing it was just a phase. But she excelled. Then dominated. She chose the scythe as her weapon of choice, a tool that felt natural and easy in her hands, and the traditionally trained sword- and spearmen had no defense against her agility and unorthodox style. When the contessa graduated at the top of her warrior class and pledged to fight for the Legion, the Aritors forbade it. When she ignored them, they threatened to exile her from the family and cut her off from all funds. This was fine with her -- a warrior needs no comforts -- but she did require one parting gift. She took the ornamental scythe from above the massive hearth, had the smiths hone the blade to a wicked edge, and set out to find Hellbourne to harvest.

 


New Kinesis Avatar: Sakura
- Sakura knows that the cherry blossom is a perfect metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life -- it is fleeting, beautiful, fragile and volatile, and should be enjoyed and appreciated while it lasts. Unfortunately, the current state of Newerth treats life more like a weed: something to be eradicated, trod upon, and used for compost if anything at all. This is why she has devoted her own impermanent existence to spreading the calm acceptance of how precious and exquisite life truly is, and it is better to drift on the winds of karma and destiny like a cherry blossom than it is to cling to a dying branch or plummet strait toward one's final resting place. Sometimes, because of one's unwillingness to accept this perspective, it is their destiny to be pruned by Sakura herself. Such is life.

 


New Monkey King Avatar: Shinobi Monkey King
- The Shinobi Monkey King is an expert at what some may call irregular warfare, covert operations, or, more often, furiously frustrating and dishonorable combat tactics. He cares not one bit, for the goal of combat is to survive while your enemy does not, and at this he is expert. His clan of assassins was hired by the monks of the Shao Temple when a pack of ronin was causing havoc among the villages, slaughtering innocents and threatening to attack the Monastery of the Way. The warrior monks certainly could have defended themselves, but the new Hellbourne threat required all of their attention, and they could not abide any more innocent deaths at the hands of the rogue samurai. After much prayer, they hired the Shinobi.

 

What the monks could not know was that the ronin were Hellbourne -- dead samurai possessed by the insidious corruption of All Hells -- and when Shinobi and his fellow assassins ambushed them the ensuing battle left only the ninja leader alive. Since that day he has pledged his skills and his blades to destroying the Hellbourne threat, and the monks shudder at the slaughter they helped create.

 


New Prophet Avatar: Prophet Prince
- The Prophet Prince of Sang-La was born into a dynastic family in the most fertile valleys of the mountain range, and for generations his ancestors had ruled the land and prospered without fear of challengers. But the young prince had visions of vultures circling above his family's estate, eager for the carrion that would soon fill their bellies. When he told his family of this, they scoffed at him. "Foolish boy," they said, "we have no enemies. And even if we did, they could not breach our walls, defeat our warriors, and destroy our family. It is impossible." Yet the visions persisted, and increased in detail. He soon foresaw the vultures tearing at the dead flesh of his family and their servants, whose butchered corpses lay strewn across the once-glorious courtyard. The prince pleaded with his family to increase the watch, raise the walls, abandon their home and seek shelter...and he was ignored.

 

When the corruption-infected samurai invaded, it was indeed a slaughter. They murdered everyone within the supposedly impenetrable walls and chased the terrified prince all the way to the top of that wall, where he stood on the edge, prepared to fall to his death rather than endure the savagery of the undead samurai. As he stepped from the parapet the vultures swept in and caught him, carrying him to the Monastery of the Way. There, he was finally safe. To train, to hone his gifts and his skills, and prepare to unleash the vengeance of his extinguished bloodline upon the Hellbourne.

 


New Pyromancer Avatar: Kojin
- KÅjin is the Japanese god of fire, the hearth, and the kitchen, and his mastery of elemental flame allows him to cleanse all impurities -- even the most insidious fire-borne corruption. When the villages of the Sang-La Mountains were helpless against the horrifying Yokai skittering out of the tunnels to All Hells, it was their prayers to KÅjin that finally saved them. Wherever a shrine to the god -- usually placed near a home's hearth -- was disturbed, KÅjin appeared to incinerate any daemons who would bring destruction upon the household. His arsenal of fire is both powerful and diverse, ensuring he has the ability to destroy any enemy he may encounter, even one forged in the dead heart of All Hells.

New Limited Edition Pebbles Avatar: P-800
- The P-800s were developed by the Electrician in the early days of the Second Corruption, intended to be the next evolution of his dreaded Shocktroopers. The goal was to design a Hellbourne soldier that could infiltrate the Legion ranks, bide its time, and wreak absolute havoc when prime targets were presented. But while the living tissue over a cybernetic skeleton coexisted well, the daemonic possession required to power the machines often resulted in erratic behavior, such as consuming vast amounts of human flesh despite having no digestive system. This usually tipped the humans off that something was awry. The Electrician eventually gave up on using sentient corruption as a life force and resorted to rudimentary hardware and processing units to power the P-800s. This worked amazingly well -- until the Engineers got their hands on one and reprogrammed it to protect Jeraziah and hunt and kill any daemon it detects.

New Devourer Avatar: Jiangshi Devo
- Centuries ago, the brutal General Po was known in every valley of the Sang-La Mountains for his ruthless treatment of anyone who stood in the way of his mission. It didn't matter if they were soldiers, royalty, monks, or peasants -- if they tried to stop him from conquering Sang-La's sacred sites and claiming them as shrines to himself, he skewered them on his butcher's blade and left them on display as a warning to others. Unfortunately for the General, this mistreatment of the dead had dire consequences. The unburied corpses he left in his wake were extremely displeased that they had not been given proper funerals, and their agitation attracted the corruption seeping into Newerth from All Hells. Infected by the corruption, the dead became reanimated as jiangshi -- corpses who subsist off the qi, or life force, of the living, and they tracked General Po, their numbers growing as he continued his campaign of slaughter.

Only when he had converted one hundred sacred area to shrines -- and killed hundreds of innocents in the process -- did General Po rest and call for a massive ceremony to celebrate his obvious greatness. When the torches were lit and the banners unfurled, the General found that his adoring crowd was entirely jiangshi, come for vengeance. They surrounded the tyrant and slowly drained his life force, dragging the agony out as long as they could, then left his corpse intact to ensure it would join them and wander eternally, undead and insatiable.

 

New Myrmidon Avatar: Scylla
- The narrow straights of the Fenwater are treacherous enough with deadly rip currents, hidden crags that can pierce even the sturdiest hull, and the occasional iceberg flowing down from the Iron Mountains. But these are nothing compared to Scylla, the hideous monster who dwells along the dark shores, waiting for ships to wander close enough to fall victim to her tentacles, sea serpents, or the crushing jaws of her ferocious wolf heads. While the sailors she devours alive are indeed mourned, the true tragedy may be that Scylla was not always a monster. She was once a beautiful young woman feeling the thrill of new love, an infatuation returned by the god Glaucus. But Circe the Deceiver wanted Glaucus for herself, and as Scylla bathed for her next rendezvous with her lover, Circe tainted the water with a potion that transformed the innocent woman into the creature who haunts the Fenwater, forever snatching the life out of her victims and happiness from their loved ones.

 

New Scout Avatar: Deranger
- The Derangers are the assassin scouts of Apex's army, slipping through enemy lines as easily as their corrupted blades pierce mortal flesh. It takes incredible discipline to leave clueless survivors in their wake as they move deep into Legion territory, but the momentary satisfaction of a mere sentry kill means nothing compared to the glory of assassinating a high-ranking military officer, a Martyr of the Sacred Order, even King Jeraziah himself. And while the thought of that triumph does indeed provide motivation, the wrath of Apex for a mission gone wrong is what truly keeps these silent killing machines from running amok and sending their body counts into the hundreds. For this, the Legion is grateful -- but once a Deranger eliminates his target and accomplishes his mission, every living soul is fair game.

 

New Tempest Avatar: Elder Rift Tempest
- The portal to the Great Rift is no longer expanding, but the forbidden sorcery required to close it continues to elude Valreia the Riftwalker and the Elder Riftwalker she has recruited to help her. Even though the Hellbourne have stationed Malphas near the mouth of the portal to stop any creatures trying to pass through, the Elder Riftspawn are too powerful for even a dozen of the sentry daemons. These monstrosities cross into Newerth with sickening ease, and it is up to the true heroes of our realm to send them back or leave their carcasses here to rot, for even the carrion eaters canâ€™t stomach them.

The Elder Rift Tempest carries within it the chaotic weather and environmental conditions of the Great Rift, and the highly flammable gasses, plummeting meteors and unpredictable voids do a quick job of turning any Newerth battlefield into a terrifying mirror of the nightmarish Great Rift. Following in the wake of the Elder Rift Cthulhuphant, the Elder Rift Tempest seeks to turn the path of destruction into a fertile landscape for the seeds of chaos.

 

New Witch Slayer Avatar: Sin Slayer
- The Sisters of the Cathedral of Hope devoted their entire lives to being caretakers of the massive church and its grounds, which included the Fields of Light, a glorious and sacrosanct cemetery for the citizens of Hope's Keep. When the Second Corruption exploded from the nearby Scar, the Sisters did not panic. They had long ago made peace with Sol, their true god, and being delivered to him did not frighten them, even though it would be preceded by blistering agony and untold horrors at the hands of the Hellbourne. Lord Commander Grimm personally led the assault upon the hallowed ground, for despite his corrupted madness, he retained knowledge of the priceless -- and powerful -- relics buried with some of the holy warriors in the Fields of Light. The Sisters tried to protect the sacred tombs with their bodies, but the rampaging daemons simply tore them apart and tossed them aside like tattered leaves. The massacre continued until one Sister remained, standing bravely before the crypt of a Martyr of the Sacred Order. She prayed for strength, for the Hellbourne to find mercy in their dark hearts, for a miracle.

Sol did not respond. But the Sin Slayer did. The Sister did not know it, but the dead Martyr she protected had carried the legendary weapon into countless holy battles and had been buried with it, and now it whispered to her from within the granite walls: Sister. The only true path to peace is through overwhelming force. Carry me to the enemy and see them shatter.

She watched the daemons draw closer, the blood from her Sisters still glistening on their teeth and claws. What would Sol want? Obedience to her vows, or vengeance upon his enemies? Her fingers twitched toward the tomb entrance, and that was all the Sin Slayer needed. It flew to her hand, bursting through the stone walls and unleashing instant destruction upon the Hellbourne. Since that gruesome day, the Sister and her weapon have become inseparable as they cut a holy swath through the corrupted ranks. They are both known by the single name -- Sin Slayer -- a name that sends a chill through even Apex's simmering blood.

= 8-Bit II =

 

+ The electronic realm of Arcadia has been sealed away from the passage of time for decades due to a defensive shield coded by the Quarter Masters. This shield had kept them isolated and safe from the chaos of Newerth, until 8-Bit Kane accidentally sliced through the power cord during his headstrong rush through the shield to join the fray. Now all the characters of Arcadia are free to roam Newerth while the Quarter Masters duct-tape the cord, jostle consoles and blow into cartridges in a frantic attempt to reactivate the shield.

 

New Master of Arms 8-Bit II Avatar: Master of Commandos
- Man, we thought the alien invasion in Arcadia was bad! This Newerth place has Parallax, the Ascension, the Great Rift, something called Mandromeda...it's a damn good thing the Quarter Masters have secretly funded the Master of Commandos with unlimited resources and ammunition to eradicate any and all extraterrestrial threats. This super solider is slightly confused about whether the Legion and Hellbourne should be considered aliens or not -- they are from another realm, after all -- but he wasn't trained to think about such large questions. He was trained to follow orders, maintain operational discipline, and shoot stuff in the face. LOCK AND LOAD.

 

New Shadowblade 8-Bit II Avatar: Gamerblade
- It doesn't matter if it's a console, PC, or mobile game. It doesn't matter if it's an RPG, FPS, or MMO (or all three). Regardless of the platform or genre, Gamerblade has a full set of gear and skills to meet all challengers and send them packing with whiny excuses about lag time and cheat codes. He may be the only player who can challenge Game Master and Dr. Gamer, and the clash of tactics, strategies, and egos will likely rival this tiff between the Legion and Hellbourne, whoever they are.

- The base avatar for Chronos has been updated!
 

New Chronos Avatar: Professor Tick Tock
- The Illuminated Orphanage of Arasunia is without a doubt the best possible place for a child who has lost their parents to the endless war with the Hellbourne. It is clean, safe, and the Sisters of the Sacred Order are stern yet loving as they raise the children to love Sol and give all praise to Him. The young man now known as Professor Tick Tock hated every second of it. Just three years old when he arrived, his first question was "Who killed mama and dada?" And he wanted answers. Every time he asked, the Sisters blathered on about faith, how Sol has a reason for everything, praise Sol and everything will be fine...this was blatantly false, as his parents had been devout worshipers of Sol, and where had it gotten them?

Eventually the Sisters gave up, allowing the boy to wander the orphanage on his own rather than have him taint the other children with his blasphemies. When he stumbled upon the maintenance workshop, it was as if he'd finally found something to devote himself to. The tools, gears, cogs, belts, hinges--they all made perfect sense. They were real. He began to build things; toys at first, then carts and scooters for the other children, then weapons (which did NOT go over well with the Sisters). The more he worked the gears, the more he saw how they could interact to manipulate the air around him, the water, energy...perhaps even time? He left the orphanage at age twelve for an apprenticeship with the alchemists -- which didn't surprise the Sisters one bit yet still made them shudder for his poor, doomed soul -- and this proved to be the final step to achieve his goal. He created a rudimentary time machine and went back to the moment his parents were murdered. His machine only allowed him to observe, not interact, and so he was frozen, helpless, as he watched. The intruder's face was concealed behind a silk scarf, but when he turned from the brutal deed and faced the glowing embers in the fireplace to catch his breath the scarf slipped. It was Jaru, of course. The Corrupted Disciple.

When the boy returned to the present, exhausted and torn between sorrow and rage, he had a mission. To finance his efforts he built and sold amazing trinkets that spun, twirled and played music. These became extremely desirable among Arasunia's elite and he rose into high society, the mysterious, melancholy young man known only as Professor Tick Tock. Even the Sisters who raised him did not recognize him on the streets, but had they learned his true identity, they would not be surprised that he seethed with obsession to perfect his time machine, to work tirelessly upon it until he could go back to that single moment and kill Jaru.

 

New Jeraziah Avatar: Beast King
- With Apex, Adrenaline and the Third Corruption ripping through all of Newerth, King Jeraziah knows it is more vital than ever to keep the Beast Horde as an ally. Even though it would offend the Sacred Order--and possibly cause the most devout among them to revolt--he swallowed his pride and knelt before his sister Ophelia, Queen of the Beasts, and recognized her as his equal in the fight against the Hellbourne. He also acknowledged that their myriad gods (chaotic as they are) are just as powerful and important as Sol. While this instantly inflamed the congregations, Jeraziah's shrewd military mind hoped it would compel the holy warriors to fight that much harder in order to prove their god was, in fact, superior. As for what the Beasts think, the King's actions will speak louder than any mere words, but they do approve of his newly forged weapons and armor -- they at least get the stink of man off him.

Version 4.3.3

= New Hero: Goldenveil =



- Goldenveil the Gilded Sellsword has fought in every corner of Newerth for countless banners, crowns, and causes -- none of which he cared about -- and the only constants he's witnessed are death and gold. These two are inextricably intertwined, and long ago Goldenveil slithered his way between them to offer his legendary, lethal skills to the highest bidder. He served as a scout and assassin for Lord Commander Maliken Grimm during the War of the Single Banner, silently dispatching enemy sentries and scoffing at any mention that he had sold his soul to the true enemy: mankind. When The Second Corruption tore Newerth asunder and gold temporarily lost all value -- survival was the only currency worth anything -- Goldenveil wisely used some of his blood money to sail beyond the known borders to fight for civilized customers.



But every new country, culture, and kingdom was eventually overcome by the relentless Hellbourne corruption, and when this sly mercenary ran out of new battlefields, he returned to the land, and profits, he knew best. The once-prosperous city of Hope's Keep was unrecognizable. It had been reduced to rubble and charred corpses within hours of The Second Corruption, but in the ensuing years the nightmare of Hell's Keep had grown to meet the demands of the Hellbourne war effort. The negotiation with Maliken Grimm was short and brutal, exactly how Goldenveil operates: Kill as many Legion soldiers as possible and collect the heads of Jeraziah and Ophelia. The reward will be a fortune, more than the coffers of Adkarna and Arasunia combined, and the Gilded Sellsword gets to keep every ounce of gold he takes from his victims along the way. Death and gold: inseparable, eternal, and Goldenveil collects them both.

= New Hero: Goldenveil =



New Goldenveil EA Avatar: Lurx
- Before the Second Corruption, the citizens of Hope's Keep shuddered at the thought of the notorious cutpurse Lurx targeting them as they skittered home from services at the Cathedral of Hope or one of the city's numerous libraries. The infamous thief had confounded authorities for years, mocking them by robbing the elite of Hope's Keep and, more often than not, murdering them even though they hadn't seen his face or heard even a whisper from him. When the Hellbourne spewed forth from the Scar and reduced the glorious city to ash and corpses, Maliken Grimm spared Lurx, finding in him a highly capable and lethal assassin who could rob the Lord Commander's enemies of gold, precious relics, or their lives. "Spared" may be used loosely here -- Grimm allowed the corruption to take hold of Lurx and transform his body into a daemonic form that better represented his inner self, and increase the terror in his victims tenfold.



New Goldenveil Avatar: Copperhead
- The ruthless bandits who roam the Great Waste preying upon supply lines, merchants, and hapless travelers may puff their chests, brag about their fighting prowess, and bray about the lack of any real warriors to challenge them, but a closer examination will show their eyes shifting to the treetops and their voices dropping to a whisper whenever they pass through a shaded grove. For these are the hunting grounds of Copperhead, the desert vigilante who shows no mercy to those who target civilians to fill their purses. Should they -- or any other corrupted soul -- cross his path, their only real hope is that he is not interested in a fair fight and makes quick work of their demise.



= 8-Bit II =



+ The electronic realm of Arcadia has been sealed away from the passage of time for decades due to a defensive shield coded by the Quarter Masters. This shield had kept them isolated and safe from the chaos of Newerth, until 8-Bit Kane accidentally sliced through the power cord during his headstrong rush through the shield to join the fray. Now all the characters of Arcadia are free to roam Newerth while the Quarter Masters duct-tape the cord, jostle consoles and blow into cartridges in a frantic attempt to reactivate the shield.



New Bombardier 8-Bit II Avatar: Short Fuse Bomber
- Short Fuse spent years trying to explode his way out of the endless mazes that trapped him in Arcadia, then stupid 8-Bit Kane accidentally set him free with that ridiculous sword of his. Well, now that this cantankerous demolitions master is free, he'll never be trapped again! Towers, trees, houses, basecamps -- they all need to be reduced to dust and pixels as quickly and loudly as possible. If any bystanders get caught in the blasts, too bad for them -- they were probably trying to fence him in again anyway.



New Blitz 8-Bit II Avatar: Power-Up Blitz
- It may take a while to get used to this top-down view, for Power-Up Blitz comes from the side-scrolling realm of Arcadia, but if there's one thing he's learned over the decades it's that speed overcomes all obstacles. Confronted by an unknown enemy? He goes fast. Teammates need help across the map? He goes faster. Spot some rings to collect? He goes so fast he bursts into flames. Those burns are mild compared to the blistering smack talk and wisecracks he slaps on everyone he cuts off, runs over, or sets afire, but hey -- the rings are worth it.




= General =



New Lodestone Avatar: Tumbler
- Tumbler has always dreamed of joining the circus and basking beneath the spotlights for the adoring crowd. But when he finally got the chance to make his dream come true, he found that the circus already had a soft, snuggly, adorable bear -- and this one had a gorgeous woman inside! How is he supposed to compete with that? With hard work and talent, that's how. So he mastered the art of balancing on a ball (pretty much), learned to play the double horn (reasonably well), and became Newerth's top umbrella artist (it's a thing). Now it's time to roll through the three rings playing masterpieces and show Goldie who the real circus bear is!



New Sand Wraith Avatar: The Storm Daughters
- The Nine Kings of the Great Waste believed one could never be too rich, too powerful, or too ruthless. Perhaps the best example of this was their practice of identifying the Storm Daughters -- young girls among the Bedouin tribes who were gifted in the ways of sorcery -- and claiming them as soldiers for their barbaric armies. The Storm Daughters were trained to use their control of the weather to utterly destroy enemies of the Nine Kings, and the sand, dust, and thunderstorms they could summon were used to mask the looting of sacred sites and fallen castles. When the Storm Daughters could take no more death and refused to fight for the brutal kings, they were sacrificed on an altar built from the gold they had helped steal.

But the Nine Kings, so focused on victory in the mortal realm, did not consider the aftershocks of their heartlessness. As they passed, one by one, into the spirit realms, something waited for them. The Storm Wraith, an elemental being created from the vengeful souls of the Storm Daughters, stood ready to serve justice upon the Nine in whatever fashion would bring them the most misery. And now that they have all been released from All Hells, she hunts them across Newerth to ensure their reign of terror does not begin anew.

New 8-Bit II Adrenaline Avatar: Puzzler
- Puzzler is in a constant state of agitation as he tries to figure out exactly where he fits in this crazy new world of Newerth. Back in Arcadia, everything was in its proper place, connected and aligned perfectly -- but this chaotic realm has him all sorts of discombobulated with tiles and segments floating and scattering everywhere, even spinning as if controlled by some other entity. He's seriously topped out with all of this disorder and the chain reaction of destruction it's causing around him. Puzzler is determined to do whatever is necessary to find his way back to Arcadia where he can re-stack himself, eliminate all of these S and Z pieces that cause so much trouble, and enjoy a quiet life as a wall.
 
New 8-Bit II Berzerker Avatar: Plumb Crazy Zerker
- Plumb Crazy Zerker used to be a quiet, humble pipefitter in the land of Arcadia, maintaining the infrastructure that kept the shield operating smoothly for the Quarter Masters. When he heard rumors that Big Boss Bubbles had kidnapped a beautiful princess and all the other heroes were too busy collecting rings, coins, or whatever trinket they coveted to help, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He quickly discovered that even though he was an excellent plumber, he was even better at rescuing damsels and smashing everything that got in his way, particularly evil mushrooms. Now that he's in Newerth with no shield to maintain he can focus entirely on his new career as a gallant hero, and it's good thing. This place has an entire Legion army that needs rescuing!

= Christmas Holiday =
 
New Christmas Solstice Avatar: Christmas Solstice
- Newerth is in absolutely NO shape for the winter holidays -- it's covered in siege rubble, scorched crops, and you can't dash ten feet through the snow without tripping over a frozen corpse. This is why Christmas Solstice is working day and night to decorate the land with festive ornaments, lights, garland, and all-around Christmas cheer. She's more than happy to share all of her decorations as she hurries from dawn until dusk -- even giving up the Christmas cloak on her back -- and so it is when night falls, she's often left with very little to keep herself warm. This usually works out just fine, as that's when the best holiday parties start to heat up and Christmas Solstice can replenish her stockings with another day's worth of holiday fun!

New Dampeer Avatar: Vampeera
- The legend whispers that it was miserable starvation, cannibalism, and eventual insanity that brought about the hideous creature known as Dampeer. But as the ancient daemons spill forth from All Hells and the Third Corruption, new, terrifying truths are surfacing with them. Vampeera is one of the original vampires, and her bloodthirsty reign pre-dates even Man's Fall from Light. She has been stalking and terrorizing the living for millennia, converting them into drained sacks of flesh and bone or servants to gather her feasts and spread her carnage -- whatever her whims and appetites call for at the moment. Captured and banished to All Hells by the Blind Prophet and his Disciples, she is now unleashed to renew her destruction. And she is very, very thirsty.

New Beauty and the Beast Empath Avatar: Beauty
New Beauty and the Beast Predator Avatar: Beast
- The Beast loved his Beauty the first time he saw her, but she did not feel the same. His hideous appearance frightened her, and no matter how many splendid gifts and perfect roses he gave her in his luxurious castle, she would not accept his twisted, clawed hand in marriage. He could not tell her he had been cursed to look as he did and could only be freed by true love. The Beauty left her Beast to return home, taking a magic mirror that allowed her to look in on him, and when she finally did she saw he was near death from heartbreak. Only when she rushed to his side and wept tears of regret did she realize she loved him, and those tears broke the curse, transforming him into the handsome prince he had always been. They have been inseparable ever since, though the curse returns when they are not physically touching. The savage Beast will kill anything that threatens his one true love, and in return the Beauty tends to his wounds and will do whatever she can to keep him safe.
 
* Sound Interactions
- If Beast gets a kill and Beauty assisted him, she will commend him.
- If Beauty gets a kill and Beast assisted her, he will commend her.
- If Beauty uses her As One ability on Beast, she will say something special to him.
- If Beauty dies close to Beast, he will cry out for her.
- If Beast dies close to Beauty, she will cry out for him. (There is a smaller chance of this happening in MidWars due to the high death ratio.)

New Lord Salforis Avatar: Techromancer
- The Techromancer may be Lord Salforis' most devious creation yet. After collecting a pile of shattered corpses from Parallax's crater impact site, the Baron of Blackwal discovered the bodies were infested with the mysterious dark matter that had arrived along with the Artificer. The substance seemed to pulse with a life of its own, and the mad necromancer was enthralled by the possibilities it could mean for his army of the dead. The first tests did not fare well -- living subjects found the dark matter slightly bitter and, ultimately, disastrously fatal -- but when applied to a fresh and once-robust corpse and combined with the Baron's dark works, the alien substance thrived. And so rose the Techromancer, an unstoppable force infused with Salforis' essence and powered by an extraterrestrial intelligence with a singular focus to destroy.
 
New Ophelia Avatar: Queen of Adkarna
- Ophelia despises the feel of man-made surfaces beneath her feet -- particularly treading upon the cold, immaculate floors of the Radiant Palace of Adkarna, built by the church to celebrate Jeraziahâ€™s reign over the Legion. It is bad enough her flesh must touch the lifeless structure, but to have to don this imperial folly for the ridiculous, meaningless ceremonies of her half-brother and his sycophants leaves her in a constant struggle to contain the wrath burning within her. A towering redwood would look glorious bursting through the stained glass ceiling, its roots cracking and warping the polished floor...

New HoN Tour Cthulhuphant Avatar: HoN Tour Cthulhu
- Behold, tryhards, the true HoN Tour Champion! HoN Tour Cthulhu holds and defends the HoN Tour trophy with a burning desire to trample any challengers who dare step into his lane and try to wrest the trophy from him. If you're mad enough to even consider this task, you'd best bring four of your most skilled comrades and have the favor of the gods on your side, for this supreme conqueror of all things HoN Tour is ready to make a trophy out of you!

= New Moon Warriors =
 
+ Some believe Lunari the Moon Goddess has become desperate with the arrival of the Third Corruption and the crumbling of the heavens and hells -- and if she has, who could blame her? Still, many of her followers and even some outsiders question her choice of the naive schoolgirls from Adkarna as the New Moon Warriors, and it remains to be seen whether this selection is one of panic or divine brilliance.
 
New Moon Warrior Drunken Master Avatar: Drunken Moonster
- Shockingly, Moonster wasn't chosen by Lunari to help save Newerth from total destruction, but that won't stop him from worshipping everything about the goddess and her New Moon Warriors. He started with small parties themed around the celebration of Moon, her friends, and all they do to keep this world safe. The theme quickly spread into elaborate decorations, then costumes, then full-blown cosplay and drinking games. Every time one of the New Moon Warriors turns a baddie into a pile of dust, whips them into outer space, or just flat-out humiliates them, everybody has to drink. Because of their total dominance on the battlefield, Drunken Moonster is in a constant state of inebriation, which has led him to believe he may actually be the missing member of this badass troupe...
 
New Moon Warrior Silhouette Avatar: Venus
- As a star dancer at the private Adkarna school, Venus was known for moving with a grace and efficiency that made even the most difficult routines look easy. It didn't hurt that she looked fantastic in the official school colors, light gold and dark gold, which also happened to be her two favorite colors (and metals). When Lunari chose her to stand beside her best friends to defend all of Newerth, it was a simple matter to apply her dance training and props to warfare rather than entertainment. It's still an art form, she insists, and she still gets to wear gold on gold.

New Pollywog Priest Avatar: Prince Polly
- The Chief Pollywog Priests of the Wild Cults wield their well-earned political and magical powers after years of intense studies, dedication to their tribes, and relentless training. The Pollywog Princes of those tribes carry abilities and influence equal to (greater than, the Princes would say) the Priests, but their power is granted by birthright and bloodline rather than merit. This creates a bit of tension between the two groups, but Prince Polly sees no reason for conflict -- a Priest is born to serve, worship, and sacrifice, and a Prince is born to be served, worshiped, and sacrificed for. That said, when his tribe is in danger Prince Polly stands right next to the Priests in the front ranks, risking his royal blood to vanquish the threat as quickly as possible. For as soon as the enemy is destroyed, the parade in his honor can begin!

New Loi Krathong Bubbles Avatar: Noppamas Bubbles
- Centuries ago, the lovely queen consort Nang Noppamas found that her lover and his court were becoming infected by undercurrents of jealousy, negativity, and warmongering. She had no way of knowing that Circe the Deceiver was twisting her claws into their thoughts, hearts and souls, but she still knew that something had to be done to cleanse her kingdom before it was too late. She created a krathong, a tiny, beautiful basket made from a lily pad and decorated with flowers. She filled it with all of her negative thoughts, her grudges, her anger, then lit a candle to venerate the gods and released the krathong into the river to carry the troubles of her people away. She urged everyone on the city to do the same, and the massive outpouring of love, forgiveness, and renewal made Circe so disgusted she actually fled to find a populace more interested in chaos and death.

New Armadon Avatar: Arma Donna
- Donna has always adored the stolid and stalwart Armadon, who looks so cute and cuddly while he's loping around that she wants to wrap him up in a big hug and keep him safe, just like he keeps his fellow Legion warriors from harm. When she started work on her amazing Armadon cosplay, she had to make a very tough decision: remain true and loyal to her gruff, lovable hero, or forgo the razor-sharp spines and sticky, smelly snot for something a little more comfortable (and acceptable at Halloween parties). She chose the latter, certain that if she ever got to show her outfit to Armadon, he would appreciate her prioritizing the safety of others -- and candy -- over authenticity.
 
New Magmus Avatar: Fireheart
- Ask any elemental warrior which force is most powerful -- earth, air, water, spirit, or fire -- and they'll certainly tell you it's whichever they wield. But Fireheart knows that even though the utterly destructive flames she controls are indeed powerful, it is another element which provides that power: love. It may be a love of fiery, scorching obliteration, but it is love, and she longs to share it with someone for eternity. It's a tragedy that nearly everyone she tries to share her love with is consumed by the passion (or the inferno), but on the rare occasion when someone can withstand the intensity of her emotional surge, Fireheart creates a life-long devotion to making sure the heat between them never dwindles. This life-long relationship typically lasts twenty minutes or so.
 
New Rhapsody Avatar: Rhapsody Hatsune Miku Ver
- Miku arrives in Newerth with the aspiration to bring joy and music to a very dark and melancholic world. Throughout her journeys, she quickly became appalled by the harsh reality of this land and decided to use her talents to heal the wounded and provide moral support for the destitute. Through her irresistable songs and dance moves, she has quickly gained devoted fans from both the Legion and Hellbourne who adore her greatly.

= New Moon Warriors =
 
+ Some believe Lunari the Moon Goddess has become desperate with the arrival of the Third Corruption and the crumbling of the heavens and hells -- and if she has, who could blame her? Still, many of her followers and even some outsiders question her choice of the naive schoolgirls from Adkarna as the New Moon Warriors, and it remains to be seen whether this selection is one of panic or divine brilliance.
 
New Moon Corrupted Disciple Avatar: Europa
- Europa has always been totally self-sufficient, handling everything that needs to get done by herself, whether it's studying, shopping, cooking, cleaning, home renovations, or athletic training. Unfortunately for just about everyone except for her, she attacks each one of these tasks with a relentless aggression that often leaves a wake of destruction, hurt feelings, and school reprimands. When Moon and Lunari shared the news that she had been chosen for the New Moon Warriors, Europa was overjoyed at the idea of using her incredible strength and new abilities to combat evil. She was slightly less enthusiastic, however, about this whole concept of a "team"...
 
New Moon Forsaken Archer Avatar: Mars
- Moon has always worried about her slightly aloof (and occasionally hotheaded) friend Mars, who bristles against the male-dominated warrior training at their private Adkarna school. She's a better rider than any boy at the academy, and her skill with a bow surpassed the instructor's years ago. It was a thrill for Mars when Lunari chose her to fight alongside Moon and the others, for she finally had the opportunity to prove how powerful she -- and all women -- can be. This was also a relief for Moon, who no longer had to fret about one of her best friends getting expelled for fighting with boys; now she only had to worry about her dying in battle against the Hellbourne.

New Thunderbringer Avatar: Raijin
- When the children of the Sang-La Mountains first hear the quiet rumbles rolling in from a distant valley, they cannot help shivering, even in the sweltering heat and humidity of summer. This sound means that Raijin, the God of Thunder, the ancient, daemonic spirit who has long haunted this land, is beating his drums in preparation to unleash his fury upon the helpless, cowering mortals. As with any storm, the best chance for survival is to shutter the doors and windows, lash everything down, and hope Raijin doesn't focus his lethal lightning upon you and yours.
 
 
== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==
 
 
= General =
 
- Direct Pathing now works properly with trees!
*i.e. when a tree is in your hero's line of travel while Direct Pathing is enabled, the hero will ignore the tree's presence and will path straight into it and push up against the tree, instead of going around it.
 
 
= Heroes =
 
Andromeda
- Void Rip now applies a 50ms Mini-Stun.
*This prevents odd situations where an enemy hero's cast action time is uninterrupted & will continue the casting even after swapping (e.g. Tempest's Elemental Void being cast from over 1000 units away).
 
Bramble
- Enhanced Shrubbery's trail will no longer block neutral camps from spawning.
 
Master of Arms
- Overcharged Shot is now blocked properly by Moraxus' Arcane Shield if the projectile is in midair when Arcane Shield is cast.
- Attack Speed bonus from Master's Call now applies properly for all of Master of Arms' alternate avatars.
 
Nitro
- Ballistic's passive range indicator will now show on Nitro at the appropriate times, and will not show to the enemy team in rare circumstances.
 
Pearl
- Bubble Pop can no longer be activated while Immobilized or Restrained.
 
Rhapsody
- Disco Inferno no longer blocks neutral camps from spawning.
 
Salomon
- Wish for Wealth's bonuses for illusions of Salomon will no longer be active when owned by a hero other than Salomon (e.g. Circe).
- Tooltip on Wish for Revenge no longer erroneously states that he gains bonus Movement Speed.
 
Sapphire
- Enemy gadgets will now properly damage Unstable Shard.
- Quickshield no longer plays a sound when damaged by Damage-over-Time (DoT) effects.
 
Shellshock
- Fireflies no longer block neutral camps from spawning.
 
Thunderbringer
- Reveal gadgets spawned from some of his skills will no longer block neutrals from spawning.
- Thunder Storm (the alternate Staff of the Master active skill) audio has been improved.
 
 
= Items =
 
Bound Eye
- Will now drop properly if the killer is invulnerable at the time of your death.
 
Doom Bringer
- Will now drop properly if the killer is invulnerable at the time of your death.

Master's Legacy
- Fixed to properly remove certain Staff of the Master effects from boosted allies when the item is dropped.
 
Ward of Revelation
- Initial reveal radius increased by 5 to remedy corner-case scenarios where the initial reveal mechanic does not reveal enemy Wards (but the persistent reveal radius does reveal enemy Wards once you have proper vision of them). 


= Mid Wars =

Zorgath
- Fixed a bug with Zorgath's first ability which didn't properly count it as a Damage over Time (DOT) effect.
*This prevents abilities like Cthulhuphant's Maddening Revenge triggering incorrectly.

= New Hero: Sapphire =
 
Sapphire of the Crystal Caverns is an ancient being, the last of her race of elemental channelers who once served as arbiters in the conflicts between Man and Beast. Sapphire lived among the tribes and packs of The Savage Lands, where the bloodshed was greatest, for she knew that if she could help create a peace there, the rest of Newerth may follow. She called sworn enemies to meet within the Crystal Caverns, deep beneath the northern Sang-La Mountains, to share their grievances and find common ground.
 
The crystals served dual purposes -- their energies created a soothing environment that made anger and resentment seem far off, like thunderclouds passing on the horizon. But should hostilities actually break out, Sapphire could channel those energies into spells that would incapacitate, protect, and, if necessary, kill.
 
Her efforts, and those of the other arbiters, seemed to be going well. Then came The First Corruption, and the eras of The Bestial Shift, Tooth and Nail, the Beast Bone Years...more and more corruption and death. Sapphire's hopes for a lasting truce between steel and claw dwindled. Peace was a jest, a word and notion that mocked her. The only remaining glimmer of a chance lay with the Red Sand tribe and their Warchiefs, who wanted to live in harmony with the Beasts -- with all beings, truly -- if the world would only let them.
 
When they were massacred by Apex's soldiers, leaving only the Warchief and Sapphire remaining, she finally realized why her beloved, healing crystals also possessed the power to kill. She had learned the hard way that sometimes peace required the utter and complete destruction of those who opposed it.

Master's Legacy
- Now outputs a chat message to your team to indicate that a player has applied Master's Legacy to another player on the team.
 
 
 
 
== Neutral Creeps - Numerical Balance Adjustments ==
 
+ Jungling at very early levels (~1-3) has been too easy for heroes that weren't initially intended to be able to jungle so early. Multiple goals will be met for doing a complete numerical overhaul of the jungle, namely:
 
*Ensures that Primary Junglers still have a relatively easy time and place in the jungle at early levels, while Secondary Junglers have a much harder time doing so and likely won't be able to jungle effectively until they obtain the proper items and levels to do so.

*Rebalances jungle difficulty so that each camp gives the proper amount of risk & reward relative to each other and with respect to each difficulty level.

*Improves consistency for the Experience, Gold, Damage Output & Health for each camp.
 
_______________________________________________
 
 
- When owned by the AI: Neutrals Creeps' attack damage against Heroes increased from 50% to 60%.
 
- The Antlore medium camp has been changed from "2x Antlings, 1x Antling, 1x Antlore Necromancer" to "1x Antling, 1x Antlore Healer, 2x Antlore Necromancer"
 
- Gold Bounty average per camp has been changed:
*Easy: ~72 Gold -> ~65 Gold
*Medium: ~95 Gold -> ~92 Gold
*Hard: ~102 Gold -> ~115 Gold
 
- Gold Bounty average per camp has been adjusted and normalized slightly to be more consistent when comparing jungle camps of the same difficulty level.
*Easy: ~65 Gold
*Medium: ~92 Gold
*Hard: ~115 Gold
*Ancients: ~220 Gold
 
- Gold Variance per jungle creep (the difference between the minimum gold and maximum gold you can obtain per creep) has been significantly tightened up to maintain consistency for junglers in the early game.
*Easy: max Gold Variance is +/-3 per jungle creep.
*Medium: max Gold Variance is +/-4 per jungle creep.
*Hard: max Gold Variance is +/-5 per jungle creep.
*Ancients: max Gold Variance is +/-15 per jungle creep.
 
- Average Health per camp has been adjusted and normalized to further maintain consistency for junglers in the early game.
*Easy: ~1400 Health
*Medium: ~1800 Health
*Hard: ~2000 Health -> ~2200 Health
*Ancients: ~3600 Health
 
- Average Damage per second (DPS) for each camp has been increased overall and made more consistent between camps to ensure that Primary Junglers are more reserved for the jungle compared to Secondary Junglers at early levels.
*Easy: ~45 DPS -> ~55 DPS
*Medium: ~60 DPS -> ~75 DPS
*Hard: ~85 DPS -> ~100 DPS
*Ancients: ~115 DPS -> ~145 DPS
 
- Average Experience per camp has been slightly adjusted (remains largely unchanged from before, but is more consistent per camp now):
*Easy: ~140 XP
*Medium: ~185 XP
*Hard: ~215 XP
*Ancients: ~340 XP

= Detailed Neutral Creep Changelog =

= Sapphire =
 
New Early Access Sapphire Avatar: Picaroon Sapphire
- Picaroon Sapphire is in high demand across the high seas of Newerth. When the battle flags fly and the cannons are primed with powder and chain shot, most sailors put on a brave face but secretly pray for Picaroon and her expert skills in the art and craft of parley. When she serves as the negotiator between two captains, her goal is to allow each of the fools to sail away feeling like they've won they day. And if they do manage to sail away, they have -- for if Picaroon can't achieve an armistice, she'll most likely sink everyone involved just to make sure they don't hurt anyone else in the process.
 
 
New Sapphire Avatar: Kinetic Sapphire
- Most battles have a long, slow fuse leading up to the actual confrontation -- a misunderstanding here, a perceived insult there, sanctions, threats, etc. -- and Kinetic Sapphire does everything she can during that slow burn to convince all sides involved that war is not the answer. Her compassion, empathy, and tales of the carnage she's seen through centuries of slaughter are sometimes enough to dissuade eager combatants from pulling the first sword or trigger. But when she cannot guide them toward peace, her vast experience in the ways of battle and death is on full display as she goes kinetic, instantly pivoting from mediation to lethal military action.
 
 
 
= New Moon Warriors =
 
 
+ Some believe Lunari the Moon Goddess has become desperate with the arrival of the Third Corruption and the crumbling of the heavens and hells -- and if she has, who could blame her? Still, many of her followers and even some outsiders question her choice of the naive schoolgirls from Adkarna as the New Moon Warriors, and it remains to be seen whether this selection is one of panic or divine brilliance.
 
New Moon Queen Avatar: Moon
- When the fun-loving schoolgirl learned she had been chosen by Lunari to not only join the New Moon Warriors, but to become the heir to Moon Queen's throne, she couldn't stop giggling. Not because anything was funny; that's just how she reacted when she felt incredibly nervous and reluctant. When Lunari told her the first mission was to find and assemble the rest of the New Moon Warriors, things got a little better -- maybe some of her friends would come along? Then she had a sweet snack and began her journey towards possibly becoming the savior of Newerth.
 

New Wretched Hag Avatar: Mercury
- A devout lover of books and learning, Mercury was at first quite resistant to Lunari's call to become the second New Moon Warrior. Time spent adventuring and fighting would mean less time studying quietly, though when her friend Moon pointed out that if they didn't save Newerth, all of the books would be consumed by corrupted flames anyway. Such a dilemma...but in the end, Mercury chose the devotion to her best friend and the survival of the planet over the comfort of a hushed library, though she did vow to learn everything she could about the enemy and use brains over brawn to defeat them whenever possible.

New Salomon Avatar: Yokai Salomon
- Deep within the Sang-La Mountains, in a valley almost entirely isolated from the outside world, a cluster of small villages lives in constant fear of the Yokai. These are creatures and phenomena that cannot be explained by the elders, the laws of nature, or any application of common sense. They simply should not exist -- yet they do. If the villagers were brave enough to venture beyond their sturdy, bamboo walls, they might discover a shadowed entrance tucked within a fold of the valley wall. An entrance with foreign, sinister runes carved around its mouth. And within that entrance, a cave, leading down, down, down, until the cold stone begins to grow warm. Then hot. Then blistering. It is a gateway to All Hells, and from there the Yokai scuttle forth from their corrupted dwellings to take the shape of nightmares.
 
Yokai Salomon is perhaps the most insidious of the Yokai because of her desire to make innocent villagers feel safe, protected, even amused, before revealing her true self. Disguised as a beautiful female merchant, Yokai Salomon roams among the villages of the Sang-La Mountains offering charms, bells, and lanterns to ward off the nasty ghosts who seek to infiltrate their homes and families. The lanterns are chÅchin obake, comical and harmless ghosts who like to surprise and entertain humans with their ridiculous expressions. This puts the villagers at ease, and just as they relax Yokai Salomon emerges from her lantern portal in full daemonic form to terrorize and slaughter the innocent.

Version 4.2.2
-------------
12 September 2017
 
 
= New Mode: Team Deathmatch =
 
+ Team Deathmatch is an action packed, casual, quick, crafted experience that is an easy way to get in and enjoy teamfights in an arena setting.
- Players get 1 Blind Ban and then may select a hero freely after the banning phase is over.
 
Objectives:
- There will be up to 7 rounds in a game of Team Deathmatch. The objective is to win as many rounds as possible and maximize the number of surviving ally heroes per round.
- The first team to reach 18 points or has the most points by the end of Round 7 will win the match!
 
Rounds:
- At the start of the game, each hero is set to Level 3 and is given 1140 Gold.
- Preparation Phase: Players will be in their preparation area, and will have time to allocate their hero's skill points and purchase items to their inventory.
- After the Preparation Phase is over, the round will start by dragging all players' heroes to their respective side of the arena.
- Teams will fight to the death! The round will end when a team no longer has any heroes in the arena.
- Once a round ends, players are revived and teleported back to their preparation area.
- The Preparation Phase for the next round will start, and players will all be given an equal amount of Experience & Gold for the next round.
*Heroes will not gain any gold or experience for hero kills/unit kills during a round, so this ensures that one team cannot gain a gameplay snowball advantage simply by winning a few rounds!
 
Notes:
- Don't stall for too long in each round!
*If the round has not ended after 1 minute, all players will be Sighted & Revealed.
*If the round has not ended after 2 minutes, all players will gain max Movement Speed, but also receive non-lethal damage equal to 3% of their Max Health every second.
 
- A Minotaur, Catman Champion and Wild Hunter will be available at the beginning of each round for heroes who are somewhat dependent on neutral creeps (e.g. Parasite and Ophelia).
*They will not attack you back while they are under control of the AI. Killing them does not grant any experience or gold.

+ As a general rule of thumb for consistency purposes, only gadgets that are interactable (i.e. you can damage it or displace it, etc.) and/or takes up space (i.e. has collision) should block neutral camps from respawning. Any gadgets that don't adhere to either of these conditions should not block neutral camps from respawning.
 
*Side note: legacy behaviour (i.e. "it has always been like that!") is not a valid justification for retaining the neutral camp block behaviour.

New Silver Coin Flux Avatar: Force of Nature
- Nature is in a continuous state of ebb and flow, but one constant is the presence of the Sentinels, warriors of Gaia powered by the earth and tasked with protecting the defenseless ecosystems of Newerth. They were once overwhelmed by the advancement and ambition of mankind, but as the planet seeks a new equilibrium in the chaos of war, the Sentinels emerge once again to stand between Nature and destruction.
 
Gravity is an undeniable force, and the Force of Nature Sentinel wields it with a stunning mastery. Pushing and pulling any object at will, the Force of Nature draws the enemies of Gaia near for an elemental thrashing, then propels their ragged carcasses away to become food for the scavengers and compost for the soil.

New Tarot Avatar: Onmyoji 
- The yin and yang, dark and bright, negative and positive--most assume these are dissonant adversaries battling for conquest over the other. But the few who have mastered both understand that the opposites are actually complementary to one another, and the balance between them holds tremendous power. OnmyÅji has spent years immersed in the yin and yang of all things, from the smallest speck of dust to the whole of Newerth and beyond, and she feels the balance of existence tipping dangerously close to the darkness. It will take every shred of her power to bind the fulcrum of this reality's energy to her own and bring it back from the brink of being snuffed out forever.
 
 
New Arachna Avatar: Youkai Arachna
- Deep within the Sang-La Mountains, in a valley almost entirely isolated from the outside world, a cluster of small villages lives in constant fear of the Youkai. These are creatures and phenomena that cannot be explained by the elders, the laws of nature, or any application of common sense. They simply should not exist -- yet they do. If the villagers were brave enough to venture beyond their sturdy, bamboo walls, they might discover a shadowed entrance tucked within a fold of the valley wall. An entrance with foreign, sinister runes carved around its mouth. And within that entrance, a cave, leading down, down, down, until the cold stone begins to grow warm. Then hot. Then blistering. It is a gateway to All Hells, and from there the Youkai scuttle forth from their corrupted dwellings to take the shape of nightmares.
 
Youkai Arachna is a creature of playful mischief. She thrives on the combination of glee and anxiety that comes with wildly popular Newerthian games such as Hide and Seek, Catch Me if You Can, and probably her all-time favorite, Save Me from the Spiders. Slightly coy and bashful when she first meets a playmate, she quickly forms a lifelong attachment with them and decides they will play together forever and ever. When her playmates feel otherwise due to exhaustion, terror, or blood loss, Youkai Arachna's nightmarish temper reveals itself. She typically regrets these moments, when she tears off legs to prevent someone from running away or binds them in a suffocating web until they realize how much fun they're having. But her sorrow is quickly forgotten when a new playmate comes along and the game begins anew.
 
 
New Sir Benzington Avatar: Bajutsu Benzi
- The elite Bajutsu Riders have defended the rural clans of the Sang-La Mountains for centuries, even being summoned by the monks of Shao Temple on the rare occasion when they need combat reinforcements. These mounted warriors are masters of the spear, and when their shock-style charges catch an enemy in the open valleys of the rugged mountain terrain they make short work of things. The Bajutsu general is a frisky veteran who has engaged in--and won--countless battles with his beloved and fearless fox mount, and the sound of their approaching charge is often drowned out by their combined purring as they anticipate the joy of the fray. And though the general is more than skilled enough to toy with his adversaries, perhaps batting them around and tossing them up a bit before finishing them off, his battle discipline is ironclad. Well, maybe a paw smack here and there...

= Fusion =

+ With the pure, true corruption from the depths of All Hells continuing to flow from Apex's portal, the other previously untapped levels and pits are also free to spew their filth and wickedness across Newerth. The Fusion Chamber is one such level, a subterranean laboratory where the damned souls were infected with a daemonic virus that tore them apart from within and rebuilt their maimed bodies with the ability to transform appendages into brutal, fiendish weapons. The Fusion Chamber did this for centuries, churning out an army of agonized soldiers prepared to wreak havoc and spread the Fusion virus across Newerth when Apex finally ascended. That day has come, and the Fusion warriors come with it.
 
New Blood Hunter Avatar: Fusion Hunter
- Fusion Hunter serves as the tracker for the Fusion army, using his own virulent blood to detect the slightest, untainted drop from a soon-to-be victim. His hideous appearance can be somewhat masked by wardrobe, allowing him to blend in with a crowd long enough to sniff out the strongest among them and identify the first target for the other Fusion terrors to descend upon. And while his visage can be masked, his hunger for flesh and blood cannot, so when someone in the masses happens to have an open wound -- or even dried blood on a collar -- Fusion Hunter cannot help himself. That hapless bleeder becomes the first of many victims, and they are lucky to be spared the carnage that follows.

New Geomancer Avatar: Leviathan
- Seeking the dark matter carried within Parallax's fulcrum to fuel their own path of galactic destruction and rule, the Leviathans have descended upon Newerth with zero regard for the war between the Legion and Hellbourne. But they are intelligent enough to join the winning faction, just long enough to expedite the eradication of one army before they turn upon their supposed allies.
 
New The Dark Lady Avatar: Vice
- Many criminals think Vice is weak (or a stripper, let's be honest) when they first see her, but her knockout appearance is 100% intentional and tactical. It gives her the split second of doubt in a takedown operation that allows her to stun, overpower, and restrain perpetrators exponentially stronger than her. Even when the goons are cuffed and face-down on the ground, sniffing dirt through bloodied noses, they're still waiting for the gag to be over and the show to start. Should they finally realize they are truly headed for the Graybar Hotel and try to reclaim their pride and freedom through violence, they will quickly learn Vice isn't just a brilliant strategist -- she's also a master of her patented Siren Sticks and will leave any would-be assailant in a cloud of instant pain and regret.

New Silver Coin Calamity Avatar: Archimedes Calamity
- Many in the Legion worship the power of Sol, but Calamity has discovered a way to use his presence against them by using mirrors and parabolic lenses to harness the sun's energy into a weapon with devastating power. A single burst from her minion mirrors is enough to set an entire ship ablaze, and when she summons her lethal lenses to surround an enemy with blazing heat, everything within the vault is reduced to steam and ashes.

New Magebane Avatar: Tutankhamun
- Circe the Deceiver watched from the shadows, disguised as an ancient beggar, a gilded merchant, a wandering shepherd, as the young pharaoh Tutankhamun rose to power. Circe had worked tirelessly to sow dissatisfaction with the Egyptian gods, and many temples and shrines lay in ruins, abandoned because of her efforts. Now the young pharaoh was restoring the temples, the people's faith, and Circe's fears. The gods had exiled her once -- never again. So she murdered the pharaoh's wife Ankhesenamun and took her form, allowing Circe to get close enough to the ruler to stage a terrible accident that left him shattered, weak, and quickly dead. Unfortunately for the gods, the Thutmoside blood line died with him 
Still in disguise, Circe had his body hastily sealed within his unfinished burial chamber to ensure no one could examine the corpse and become suspicious. But the gods did not need physical evidence of her crimes. They created Tutankhamun's Curse, a vow of vengeance against Circe that would bring the young, powerful pharaoh back to life when the heavens and hells collapsed, releasing the gods and spirits from their prisons. And even though it was Apex and the Third Corruption that brought this catastrophic event about, the curse was nevertheless triggered, and now Tutankhamun rises from his sarcophagus as a warrior of justice for the gods to hunt his killer.
  
New Demented Shaman Avatar: Firefighter Shaman
- Firefighter Shaman lives for battling flames, and it doesn't matter if they come from a carelessly tossed torch, an epic lightning strike, or the fires of daemonic corruption -- they will be extinguished! When she arrives on-scene, civilians know an unbreakable barrier has been placed between them and the raging inferno, and the storm of skills she unleashes upon the flames instantly turns a terrifying disaster into an amazing display of water, steam, and harmless ash.
 
New Klanx Avatar: Firefighter Klanx 
- Firefighter Klanx is constantly searching for signs of smoke, and as soon as he spots a potential threat he loads up, mobilizes, and pounces to unleash the full firefighting arsenal carried by him and his crew to extinguish the danger before it can become a problem for anyone else. As for the cleanup, well, most troublemakers are biodegradable.

+ The Punks of Newerth are here to leave their mark on the battlefield!

New Punks of Newerth Chronos Avatar: Punk Chronos
- Punk Chronos earned legendary status among the graffiti gang when he went for the ultimate heaven spot in all of Newerth -- the City of Iron clock tower. With its constantly churning gears, levers, and hydraulic pistons, this wonder of engineering might as well be a meat grinder as well as a timekeeper. But Punk Chronos made it to the top, got his arsenal of paint cans ready -- then ran out of time. The clock tower struck midnight and dragged him into its guts, finally spitting him out three hours later but keeping an arm and a leg as penance for trying to deface its masterfully crafted surface. Punk Chronos learned a key lesson that day, and even though he lost a couple appendages, he didn't lose a bit of courage. He vowed to become the master of time, to forever know the perfect moment to strike, to retreat, to empty a full can on a masterpiece or hit the target with a single drop, a thousand times, to create his work of art. For Punk Chronos, time is just another medium for a true artist to work with.
 
New Punks of Newerth Flint Beastwood Avatar: Punk Flint
- Punk Flint used to belong to the rival Warlords gang, but they were way too focused on fighting and didn't seem to care much about art, style, or artsy style, three things he considers to be vital to a proper existence. For him, artsy style means sauntering down the middle of a busy street popping paint splatters at targets three blocks away to create dazzling masterpieces, and looking hella fresh while doing it. Granted, he's barely over eighteen, and grizzled members like Punk Smith just shake their heads at the audacity, muttering about how he'll have to learn the hard way, but Punk Flint sees things differently -- instead of him learning the hard way, these old Punks are going to have to learn the new way.
 
New Punks of Newerth Rampage Avatar: Punk Rampage
- On rare mornings, authorities across Newerth will awake to find their streets and buildings entirely covered in dazzling paint so vivid and artistically applied that it seems to vibrate to an unheard beat. They shake their fists and bellow about the ragamuffin gang of Punks and their scofflaw ways, but these end-to-end masterpieces are the work of just one Punk: Punk Rampage. Whenever the system's inherent oppression, ridiculous rules, and stifling expectations get to be too much, this spray-painting steamroller just can't hold back. He gasses up the Horned Hot Rod, cranks up the volume, and stampedes through entire city blocks to let the paint and frustrations fly!
 
= Ultimate =
 
New Ultimate Puppet Master Avatar: The Sculptor
- It is a proper shame that nearly every being in Newerth is either dull, ugly, or a staggering combination of both. Even the gods themselves descending from their heavens proved a disappointment, as they turned out to be petty, self-absorbed, and in some cases unbearably flatulent. The only alternative for The Sculptor -- a man with impeccable taste and unquestionable genius -- is obvious: if he is to have any hope of spending time with an equal, he's going to have to create this entity himself. It took him years of research and trial and error (due to flawed materials, not design!), but he finally created a sculpture that was as beautiful as he. In a rare outburst of joy, he kissed her steel lips in celebration and found them to be...warm.

Her eyes opened, blinked, and looked into his. "I am Apega," his creation said. "I am yours, and you are mine. No other is worthy to partake of us." The Sculptor was stunned, but his joy only grew. Through some unforeseen alchemy of blended metals, elemental materials, and possibly his sheer force of will, his dream companion had come to life. One potential downside: she embodied his sheer disdain for all other living beings, yet she did not posses his restraint. When The Sculptor took Apega to a ball to drive the other men mad with envy and the women wild with jealousy, he was slightly horrified when his dearest slaughtered the entire lot. She's such a rascal! Apega will only grow more powerful as The Sculptor shows her the world and she gathers more items and materials to augment her brilliant design. If these two are indeed the last two remaining beings on Newerth, at least they will be happy together. Until she kills him.

New Punks of Newerth Blacksmith Avatar: Punk Smith
- Punk Smith comes from the old school of Punk rebellion, when you couldn't even walk on the same sidewalk as the gang unless you'd tagged the armor of a Captain of the Guard -- while it was being worn. If the Guard happened to catch you, or you came across a rival gang while you were trying to pass initiation, well...that's why you made sure your spray painter doubled as a warhammer. Punk Smith tries to teach the new blood how to do things the right way, stay relatively safe and out of shackles, and crush and mix their own custom paint colors, but they're all rebels -- they don't listen to a damn thing he says, and he wouldn't want it any other way.
 
New Punks of Newerth Hammerstorm Avatar: Punk Hammer
- The Punk Hammer loves spreading art across Newerth as much as any other Punk, but his greatest pleasure is removing tryhard toy graffiti from existence so no one else has to suffer the unbearable pain of looking at it. When he encounters these incredible wastes of paint (basically any graffiti created by someone other than a Punk) he doesn't settle for a mere slash or dis across the offending piece -- that would be too kind, and someone might still be able to see the original piece (of garbage). Instead, he uses his bass hammer to reduce the entire structure to rubble, then smashes the pieces into dust and powder. Then he finds the so-called "artist" and does the same thing to them.
 
New Punks of Newerth Nomad Avatar: Punk Nomad
- While Punks like Ravenor, Valk and Pyro love to get the whole gang together and blast the city with paint and parties, Punk Nomad is a bit of a loner, preferring to wander the streets on his own, letting the architecture guide him to the perfect stone and steel canvas for his inspired masterpieces. This also lets him stalk the rival gangs drawn to the Punks' revelry and pick them off one by one, leaving a series of brightly painted and barely living art displays in his wake.
 
New Punks of Newerth Pyromancer Avatar: Punk Pyro
- Punk Pyro has no time for mere tags, slashes, or even wildstyles -- she's all about painting burners: large, elaborate pieces that are so intense they seem to radiate right off the surface. To bust one of these massive masterpieces out before she's caught or confronted by a rival gang, she needs to work insanely fast and be ready to blast trespassers away at the first sign of trouble. This is not a problem -- her paint pump is capable of covering a wall in mere seconds and drowning chumps even faster, and she has a very sticky trigger finger.
 
New Punks of Newerth Ravenor Avatar: Punk Ravenor
- There's nothing like a graffiti rave to get the Punks ready for a mission of tagging and slashing, and Punk Ravenor gets the party started right by carving up the floor with her Rollerblade moves and baller wildstyle artistry. She doesn't suffer amateurs, boring parties, or lazy sticker slap tags, and if she comes across another crew trying to disrespect the Punks' graffiti, she's more than ready to overwhelm them with a shocking display of power, paint, and pink and purple pain!
 
New Punks of Newerth Swiftblade Avatar: Punk Swifty
- Punk Swifty brings the flair of a pure artist to every aspect of his life â€“ his painting, music, dancing, weaponry, and especially his street fights. It's often hard for the other Punks to tell if Swifty is painting a masterpiece, choreographing a new vocal and step routine, or hacking and slashing a rival gang. This can be embarrassing, as they sometimes end up punching a backup dancer in the face or trying to sing along with a victim's cries of agony, but you can guarantee Punk Swifty will turn whatever chaos he's created into another piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of bright paint, epic beats, and splattered blood.
 
New Punks of Newerth Valkyrie Avatar: Punk Valk
- Punk Valk views her spray paint art through a different prism than the other Punks. For her, the outrageous wildstyle designs she creates are inspired by a heavenly power, a god-tier muse who has chosen her as the conduit for its angelic artworks. Fortunately, this being has also chosen her to party hard, constantly live on the bleeding edge, and drag the rest of the Punks along for the daring and divine ride. If anyone ever convinces her how insane it all is...she'll probably laugh.

= Mid Wars Beta =
 
Mid Wars Beta is a new mode in addition to Mid Wars. It contains changes that occur periodically to freshen up the Mid Wars experience.
*Mid Wars Beta is not a replacement for Mid Wars, but is an additional mode that is available to play alongside Mid Wars.
 
- Experience per minute increased from 45 to 240.
- Starting Gold increased from 850 to 1000.
- Passive Gold per minute increased from 100 to 200.
 
- All Healing and Health Regeneration is reduced by 30%.
- Grants a bonus 3 Mana Regeneration per second.
- Mana Regeneration is increased by 100%.
 

= Mid Wars =
 
The following changes apply to both Mid Wars and Mid Wars Beta:
 
- The Backdoor Protection System in Mid Wars now only applies to Main Base Structures (instead of the towers).
*As a result, the older Health Regeneration mechanics on the Main Base Structures in Mid Wars have been removed, and their Health Regeneration has been lowered from 105 to 3 in Mid Wars.
 
- Earliest Concede timepoint in Mid Wars decreased from 15 minutes to 10 minutes.
 
Ban Mechanic Change
- Mid Wars now uses "Hero Ban".
- Bans are no longer blind in the Banning phase.
*This ensures that 10 heroes will be banned every game.
 
Merrick's Bounty
- Disabled from being purchased on the Mid Wars map.
+ Merrick's Bounty was encouraging passive play in Mid Wars, which is not an intended goal for this map.
*In Mid Wars Beta, the Gold adjustments compensate for the removal of Merrick's Bounty.
 
 
 
 
= UI =
 
Alt + Leftclicking now has additional features!
- Alt + Leftclicking item names that have modifier changes (e.g. Steamboots, Bottle) now display the proper item name in Team Chat.
- Alt + Leftclicking a Rune now mentions that a particular rune is available to use (in addition to the ping that it does on the minimap already).
- Alt + Leftclicking an item in your Stash mentions the item is in your Stash in Team Chat.
- Alt + Leftclicking an item currently in the Automated Courier delivery inventory while it is on its way to you mentions this fact in Team Chat.
 
 
= General =
 
Experience Changes
- Experience given from lane creeps when another ally hero is present increased from 20% to 50%.
- Experience gained from hero kills while your hero is dead is reduced by 25% (instead of gaining full experience from hero kills while you are dead).

- Experience for hero kills is reduced by a percentage for each additional real ally hero present past the second real ally hero.
*Real ally Hero means a non-Heropet, non-Mimic, non-illusion hero.
 
Examples:
*1 real Ally Heroes near the killed enemy hero (i.e. just yourself) = 0% Hero Kill Experience Penalty
*2 real Ally Heroes near the killed enemy hero (i.e. yourself and 1 other ally hero) = 0% Hero Kill Experience Penalty
*3 real Ally Heroes near the killed enemy hero (i.e. yourself and 2 other ally heroes) = 10% Hero Kill Experience Penalty
*4 real Ally Heroes near the killed enemy hero (i.e. yourself and 3 other ally heroes) = 30% Hero Kill Experience Penalty
*5 real Ally Heroes near the killed enemy hero (i.e. yourself and 4 other ally heroes) = 50% Hero Kill Experience Penalty
 
Gold Changes
- Removed the Bounty Loss Reduction (of 25 Gold per kill in the streak) when your Kill Streak ends.
*This means that the person who had the Kill Streak will no longer lose less Gold upon dying, i.e. the person with the Kill Streak lose more Gold upon dying.
 
- Lane Creeps: after losing aggro, Lane Creeps will now re-aggro against Melee Lane Creeps before attempting to re-aggro against other units.
*This prevents them from re-aggroing onto Ranged Lane Creeps when there are other Melee Lane Creeps around, thus lowering the amount of creep equilibrium disturbances when a hero aggros Lane Creeps.

= Fusion =
 
+ With the pure, true corruption from the depths of All Hells continuing to flow from Apex's portal, the other previously untapped levels and pits are also free to spew their filth and wickedness across Newerth. The Fusion Chamber is one such level, a subterranean laboratory where the damned souls were infected with a daemonic virus that tore them apart from within and rebuilt their maimed bodies with the ability to transform appendages into brutal, fiendish weapons. The Fusion Chamber did this for centuries, churning out an army of agonized soldiers prepared to wreak havoc and spread the Fusion virus across Newerth when Apex finally ascended. That day has come, and the Fusion warriors come with it.
 
New Fusion Amun-Ra Avatar: Fusion Ra
- Fusion Ra specializes in closing with the enemy and dealing a tremendous amount of damage throughout their ranks with his cleaving blade and infected, boiling blood. Merely standing in his wake is enough to burn a normal human alive, and the lucky ones perish before the Fusion virus can twist their smoldering bodies into a new soldier for the cause. Even though Fusion Ra's flesh may succumb to the enemy's blades and bullets, it is the blood they must kill, and when his mangled corpse rises once again to carry the fight to his killers, there are none who are strong or brave enough to deal the true final blow.

New Dampeer Avatar: The Gentleman Killer
- The high society of Adkarna seems very genteel and cosmopolitan, and most of the Legion's military consider them to be helpless doves who wrinkle their noses at the very thought of violence. But the ruthless politics and maneuvering for status have their own forms of battle, and The Gentleman Killer is a master of these. Able to converse in multiple languages, pick the perfect wine to accompany any meal, and discuss history, current affairs, and coarse gossip with equal savvy, he can manipulate any victim into practically giving their own blood to please him. And when that doesn't work, he lures them to a darkened room or alley and removes them as an obstacle -- brutally, efficiently, and permanently -- before dabbing the blood from his hidden razors and emerging from the shadows to continue his work.
 
New Draconis Avatar: Dragoness
- The Dragoness of Death's Cradle does not appreciate the attention Calamity and her ridiculous pet Sunder are getting from all of Newerth. After all, the Dragoness and her fiery little companions have been causing infernos and cataclysms for centuries, and no one mentioned anything about a Third Corruption. And now, with Apex and his True Evil flowing over every hill and valley, it is time for her to show these pathetic humans and daemons what ancient, elemental fire can do to flesh, regardless of whether it is alive or dead. After all, everything burns â€“ it's just a matter of degrees.
 
New Master of Arms Avatar: El Maestro
- El Maestro is an infamous gangster and stick-up artist who makes his living -- and his reputation -- robbing other gangs like the All Hells Angels while they're running gold, weapons and potions for the goblin black market. He's a master of the arsenal he carries, and the rare survivors of his attacks claim El Maestro can make his guns sound like an orchestra of chaos and destruction. Whether it's a slow, steady build to an explosive crescendo or a rapid staccato flurry that assaults every sense (and everyone), each epic performance from El Maestro is enough to bring any rival gang to its knees...then face-down in the street while El Maestro escapes with their loot.

Version 4.1.3
-------------
20 June 2017
 
 
= New Hero: Warchief =
 
The legendary horn Warcry has been passed from generation to generation within the Red Sand tribe of The Savage Lands, carried by the warrior strongest in spirit, fighting skill, and honor. This person -- male or female -- is called Warchief until the time comes to pass into the spirit world and hand the horn to the next great leader, who is responsible for the survival of the tribe's people and ways. This is no easy task, for the Red Sand tribe has spent centuries clashing with the Scouts to the northeast and the foul raiders who wander out of the Savannahs to the south. When the Beast Horde became the primary enemy of man, Warchief refused to raise the tribe's weapons against the creatures of the land, who had given them companionship and sustenance since the days of the first elders. To seal this vow, and in a gesture of unprecedented respect, the leader gave Warcry to the animals for safekeeping. This ensured it would not be used against the Beasts or fall into evil hands, should the Red Sand tribe be exterminated by the encroaching armies of Lord Commander Maliken Grimm.
 
But Grimm's Legion soldiers found The Savage Lands to be nearly as hostile as the Red Sand warriors, and their ranks withered due to casualties, thirst, and desertion until they pulled out entirely when word arrived that the Lord Commander had gone mad and abandoned his people. The tribe lived in relative peace while the rest of Newerth boiled under The Second Corruption and the Rise of Apex, but when Apex's soldiers finally encountered the Red Sand warriors, Warchief and his people were woefully unprepared. Without the strength of the elders contained within Warcry, the entire tribe was massacred save for Warchief, who was possessed by a daemon and forced to recover the powerful horn from the beasts so it could be used by the True Evil.
 
When the enthralled Warchief arrived to take the horn from his animal brothers and sisters, the Beasts knew something was amiss. The horn's animal guardian cast a spell upon the horn before Warchief could blow it on Apex's behalf, and when he did, the spirits of the elders ripped the daemon from Warchief and trapped it within the great horn. Now he carries this devastating weapon against the forces who destroyed his entire world, and when they are defeated he will finally join his people and elders in the spirit world.

= Warchief =

New Early Access Warchief Avatar: Purgatory
- The name Purgatory sends a chill down the spine of any Sol-fearing Legion citizen and propels members of the Church of Arasunia into a frenzy of prayers and gestures to ward off the inherent evil. Once the high priest of the Sacred Order, this man succumbed to the temptations of corruption and opened the gates -- both physical and spiritual -- to allow a Hellbourne cult to infiltrate the highest ranks of the church. This resulted in The Doom Bringers, genocide in the name of Sol and Lord Commander Grimm, and countless other unspeakable acts committed beneath the banner of Sol. When The Doom Bringers learned the truth about their corrupted master, they executed him with one of their legendary swords, then shattered the blade, condemning his soul to an eternity trapped between the living and the dead.
 
New Warchief Avatar: Hex
- The legendary medicine men of the Scourge Tribe may have started out with the benevolent intent of healing their own people, but the unbelievably harsh conditions and constant battle for survival within Death's Cradle made it brutally apparent that the best way to ensure the tribe's survival was to redirect all of their energies and conjurings toward maiming and killing the enemy. Hex is the chief of these warrior shamans, his body, weapons, and totems coursing with the lethal energy of the Cradle itself, harnessed by the self-scarification he performed during thousands of sacred ceremonies. When his scars begin to glow with the power of Death's Cradle, a state of unshakable calm flows over Hex, making him the devastating eye of the storm within the chaos of battle.

New Glacius Avatar: Wildfire Glacius
- Nothing terrifies a sailor more than the thought of rampant flames on the open sea, and the mere mention of Wildfire is enough to send an entire crew into a frenzy of soaking the decks and sails even though an entire ocean would not douse the creeping blue flames once they've been unleashed. Wildfire's personal recipe for agonizing, burning death includes the rendered remains of his victims and rare compounds found only in the darkest depths of The Boiling Sea, tweaked with his insidious alchemy to ensure all life is snuffed out long before the Wildfire even begins to fade.

New Kane Avatar: Mutineer Kane
- Usurpers need vacations too, but Kane seems to think that means taking a break from killing kings so he can scour the open seas for captains and admirals to slaughter. He is a one-man boarding party more devastating than a full broadside fusillade, and any captain who chooses to face off with him instead of running â€“ or trying to, anyway â€“ is certain to face a swift and brutal mutiny at the hands of a more judicious crew.
 
New Monkey King Avatar: Monkey Singer
- The Monkey King has many skills -- dashing, vaulting, irritating Ophelia and casuals -- but no one in Newerth knew how beautiful and melodic his singing voice was, and this noble warrior could no longer keep this amazing talent to himself. Rather than let his voice be judged by a biased audience who already adores (or despises) him, Monkey King has chosen to don a complete disguise so his heavenly crooning can stand on its own. And if the critics decide he's a no-talent, tone-deaf poseur, he can always show them how to really rock with a Wan Jim Slam.

New Silver Edition Succubus Avatar: Incubus
- With Calamity attempting to begin the Third Corruption, the Great Rift expanding, the Crystal Magi seeking the lost Paragons, and Parallax skewing time and space around him, an alternate reality has woven into Newerth as we know it.
In this reality, Incubus is the male version of Succubus, and even though this daemon has excelled at seducing women for ages, he found himself enraptured by the insidious Sylvia, who used him to create her daughter, Ophelia, who would bring about the Second Corruption.
 
= Plushies & Misfits =
 
+ War has touched every inch of this magical land, and not even the Illuminated Orphanage is safe. Within the high, clean walls maintained by the Sacred Order of Arasunia, a constant battle rages for dominion over one of the most highly contested plots in all of Newerth -- the toddler's playroom. Divided by a river of blankies and soiled diapers, the romping area has opposite corners claimed by two factions: the Plushies, adorably soft and cuddly dolls, and the Misfits, unsettling and dangerous toys tainted by the echo of evil left behind by Jaru the Corrupted Disciple. The Plushies find haven in the Nursery Corner, from where they strive to protect the orphans and Sisters within the orphanage, while the Misfits dwell across the room in the Cursery Corner, plotting to overtake the entire campus. Let the stuffing fly!
 
New Plushie & Misfit Myrmidon Avatar: Plushie Myrmidon
- Bath time is a joyous occasion in the Illuminated Orphanage playroom, when the children get to wash off the day's dirt with steaming kettles of water and the precious essential oil soaps they made by hand with the Sisters. And no bath time would be complete without Plushie Myrmidon, whose hilarious water antics and gentle scrub brush make the torturous experience of washing behind one's ears not just tolerable, but actually fun! The children don't need to know that their beloved bath toy is also there to protect them from any Misfits who try to cause trouble in the tubs, particularly Misfit Myrmidon, who has a penchant for biting toes beneath the warm, soapy waters.
 
New Plushie & Misfit Myrmidon Avatar: Misfit Myrmidon
- Misfit Myrmidon loves to bite toes. Big toes, little toes, second toes that are longer than the big toe -- it doesn't matter to him and the multiple stuffed hydra heads attached to his tail. As soon as he hears the bathwater kettles begin to whistle, he slithers across the playroom floor and, when Plushie Myrmidon isn't looking, slips into the tubs and waits for the children to test the waters with their oh-so-wiggly toes. When they dip those digits in (Or even better, jump in with both feet!) Misfit Myrmidon chomps on the first toe he sees and turns his serpent heads loose to find their own piggies. But my oh my, when one of the Orphanage Sisters dares to put her toes in the tub to soothe her aching feet, this evil bath toy evolves into a massive Misfit to better attack the adult-sized targets. Many a child has gone to bed dirty and stinky for fear of Misfit Myrmidon.
 
New Plushie & Misfit Bubbles Avatar: Plushie Bubbles
- The children of the Illuminated Orphanage love to sit and watch the teeming life within the playroom's terrarium for hours. They whisper how the wild vines, lush green mosses, and delicate ferns must seem like an entire world to the tiny insects and amphibians who bustle over the foliage and nestle in the cool, dark soil. Plushie Bubbles is the caretaker of this miniature ecosystem, and he helps the children learn about the precious balance of life they are witnessing and playfully quizzes them about the names of the flora and fauna. When the windows outside the orphanage grow dark and the children go to sleep, however, his role changes from caretaker and teacher to guardian as he protects terrarium and its inhabitants from the wicked Misfit Bubbles, who would love to see the tiny world turned into a monument to himself.
 
New Plushie & Misfit Bubbles Avatar: Misfit Bubbles
- Misfit Bubbles used to perch upon the edge of the playroom's terrarium, a place of honor where the orphans loved to set him and pretend he was the ruler and lord of the tiny world. It was all in good fun, and he and Plushie Bubbles would chuckle about it as they worked together to keep the glass clean and the soil moist. But over time, Misfit Bubbles began to believe the plants, insects, and amphibians actually were worshipping him, and he remained in his lofty seat while Plushie Bubbles did all the work. The corruption simmering in the orphanage sensed this growing conflict and wormed its way into Misfit Bubbles' stitching until he was convinced the entire terrarium should be clear cut and replaced with a monument to his greatness. He constantly recruits other Misfits in his efforts to outwit or outfight Plushie Bubbles so the entire playroom can bask in the glory of his shrine, and someday, he will prevail!
 
= EXO =
 
+ In the ultimate alliance between the Legion and Beast Horde, the tech-focused Engineers have set aside their spreadsheets and stress tests and looked to the research that has been ongoing for millennia: nature's evolution. When the Engineers examined the shells, exoskeletons, and carapaces of the Beast warriors, they found systems of armor that, when applied to man-made materials, created external protection that was lighter, more flexible, and stronger than anything Newerth had yet seen.
 
New EXO Soulstealer Avatar: EXO Soulstealer
- It was a critical response to the new corruption spewing from Apex's portal, and a lifesaving breakthrough for the lone survivor of a Legion patrol tasked with finding a weakness -- any weakness -- in the True Evil's gateway to All Hells. "Survivor" is used loosely, as this warrior was torn in half and had her hands severed by a single strike from one of Adrenaline's shards, and lived only because the horrendous wounds were instantly cauterized. The Martyrs kept her shocked body alive long enough to get her to the EXO team, who used their new technology to do more than just keep her on life support: it made her more powerful, resilient, and deadly than before her fateful mission. Now for some payback.
 
= The Doom Bringers =
 
+ The Doom Bringers are an outcast group of peacekeepers who were once part of the Sacred Order of Arasunia. They were the iron fist of the church, crushing rebellions and extinguishing entire sects of pagan worship in order to bolster the power and influence of Arasunia. When The Doom Bringers learned they had been recruited, trained, and deployed by a daemonic cult that had infiltrated the highest ranks of the church while Lord Commander Maliken was enthralled by Sylvia, these warriors slaughtered every member of the clergy they could find, burned half of Arasunia, and renounced the Sacred Order. They were branded as outlaws and hunted mercilessly by Maliken Grimm's High Knights, and the few surviving members faded into the shadows. But they did not stop their work. Their mission to carry judgement and sentencing to all lawbreakers â€“ a nebulous term they alone define to fit their agenda â€“ has continued to this day. They remain anonymous, recruiting carefully, and while their weapons and tactics have evolved along with the technology of Newerth, they still carry the Doom Bringer blades as a symbol of their power and a reminder of their sins.
 
New Doom Bringer Scout Avatar: Vardik
- Vardik is a specialist even among The Doom Bringers, slipping into the undercurrent of whispers, rumors, and secrets to root out even the most clandestine enemies of peace. True, he has, on occasion, been the sole source of these murmurs, but only when the target is obviously guilty and no hushed testimonials can be found. And though he is most comfortable and effective in the covert business of intelligence gathering, when the sentence is ready to be carried out Vardik is exceedingly prepared to unsheath the blade and make quick work of the offender.

New Plushies and Misfits Deadwood Avatar: Plushie Deadwood
- The box gardens beneath the windows in the Illuminated Orphanage playroom may be tiny, but they yield a surprising bounty of flowers, herbs, and small, sweet fruits. This is partially due to the love and attention from the orphans and their gentle hands, but that alone won't protect the fragile plants from being trampled and destroyed by the rampaging Misfits. That responsibility and honor belongs to Plushie Deadwood, who along with his gang of helpful critters and stuffed mushrooms is dedicated to keeping the gardens alive so they can continue to bring joy and nourishment to the orphanage. When a Misfit dares to set foot within the gardens, they also make the mistake of getting too close to Plushie Deadwood's powerful grasp -- and from there, it's only a matter of time before they become muddy, soggy compost for the lovely plants.
 
New Plushies and Misfits Deadwood Avatar: Misfit Deadwood 
- The moldy, mildewy Misfit Deadwood relishes the opportunities he gets to stomp through the playroom's box gardens, clearcutting the delicate leaves and uprooting the fragile stems to leave a swath of dead plants, trampled fruit, and crying children in his wake. When that pesky Plushie Deadwood shows up and tries to chase him out (which is not what happens -- Misfit Deadwood was ready to leave anyway), this rotten rascal savors the fact that the plants left standing will soon be overrun by the moldy spores and blight he carries in every fiber of his stuffed being. Enjoy your graveyard gardens, brats!
 
New Plushies and Misfits Pandamonium Avatar: Plushie Panda
- Plushie Panda is a therapy doll meant to bring a sense of peace and calm to the orphans who hold him, and his soft fur and cushy stuffing make him perfect for tender hugs, even to serve as a temporary pillow when the children become so relaxed they doze off. But peace and calm must sometimes be protected, just like the orphans, and when the Misfits disturb the serenity of the playroom -- or commit the ultimate crime and actually strike an orphan -- Plushie Panda does not hesitate to unleash another relaxation technique he has mastered: beating Misfits over the head with his staff until they lose consciousness.
 
New Plushies and Misfits Pandamonium Avatar: Misfit Panda
- Misfit Panda was once a beloved plaything for the orphanage's children, a soft, bouncy doll handcrafted to serve as a wrestling partner, punching bag, and outlet for young frustrations. But the doll had a temper, and after one playful punch too many, he snapped and did the unimaginable -- he hit back. When the child ran away crying, Misfit Panda picked up his doll-sized staff and smacked another orphan, then another, until the entire playroom was a flurry of bawling children. Misfit Panda had never been happier, and since that day he takes every chance he gets to send the poor orphans crying and flying through the air. Even the Sisters fear his tainted wrath, and only when the heroic Plushie Panda intervenes does this furious face-smasher leave the playroom in peace.

New Gladiator Avatar: All Hells Angel
- The All Hells Angels are a ferocious biker gang who splintered from the already-terrifying Death Prowlers when the hit-and-run teams deemed these warriors too dangerous, even for them. After the split, the All Hells Angels became mercenaries, providing security for anyone with enough gold to pay the price, running weapons and potions for the goblin black market, even reaching into the deepest Caligo Alcazar prison cells to assassinate hard targets. They ride fast, shoot first, and consider anyone not in their gang to be a mortal threat and enemy. And when an All Hells Angel spots an enemy, it's a fight to the death -- but never a fair one.
 
New Gunblade Avatar: Gunmaiden
- The Gunmaidens are an elite, secretive group of assassins who were forced into existence by the tyrannical rulers during Lord Commander Maliken Grimm's reign over the Legion. Many of the men and women who rose to power under Grimm did so through ruthless means, and they were feared and despised by their subjects. To secure their power, they imposed extremely harsh laws and restrictions across their domains to keep the people weak and incapable of revolt, often resorting to group hangings and slave labor to tamp down any thoughts of an uprising.
What these rulers did not anticipate, however, was that some of the slaves brought into their lush estates to serve their every need came with years of covert training in the art of death. The Gunmaidens specialized in acting scared, subservient, and helpless, until the time was right and they revealed their true nature, unleashing a lethal hail of bullets and blades that left throne rooms painted in blood and throngs of liberated people dancing in the streets.

New Silver Coin Parasite Avatar: Nuclear Parasite
- As the arrival of Apex and his soldiers threatens all of Newerth, the previously unknown sub-levels of All Hells continue to crack open and spew their filth across the landscape. And as if the parasitic abominations growing within the black, primordial cesspools weren't bad enough, the sludge that leaked from that crevice wormed its way through the depths of the cursed realms until it congealed within a nuclear waste storage facility, long-since buried and forgotten by the Lost Civilization. The horror that evolved there is beyond a mutated parasite -- it is an entirely new form of daemonic creature whose body is constantly consumed by the radiation simmering within every cell of its being, driving it to drain the life from everything it encounters in order to replace its dying flesh.

= Plushies and Misfits =

+ War has touched every inch of this magical land, and not even the Illuminated Orphanage is safe. Within the high, clean walls maintained by the Sacred Order of Arasunia, a constant battle rages for dominion over one of the most highly contested plots in all of Newerth â€“ the toddler's playroom. Divided by a river of blankies and soiled diapers, the romping area has opposite corners claimed by two factions: the Plushies, adorably soft and cuddly dolls, and the Misfits, unsettling and dangerous toys tainted by the echo of evil left behind by Jaru the Corrupted Disciple. The Plushies find haven in the Nursery Corner, from where they strive to protect the orphans and Sisters within the orphanage, while the Misfits dwell across the room in the Cursery Corner, plotting to overtake the entire campus. Let the stuffing fly!

New Plushies and Misfits Cthulhuphant Avatar: Plushie Cthulu
- Everything is rainbows, sunshine, and adorable stuffed animals for Plushie Cthulu -- and we mean everything. Whether a child is sobbing from a disturbing nightmare or a Sister is weeping because a certain green, winged Misfit keeps stomping through naptime, Plushie Cthulu is there to cheer them up with an endless supply of delightful rainbows and cuddly lovies. As an added bonus, Misfit Cthulu absolutely cannot stand anything bright, colorful, and adorable, and these keep him away while the children sleep and the Sisters get some well-deserved rest.

New Plushies and Misfits Cthulhuphant Avatar: Misfit Cthulu
- The Misfit Cthulu doll is reviled among the Sisters of the Illuminated Orphanage because of the havoc he wreaks upon the most sacred hours of the day -- naptime. When the rowdy children finally settle onto their blankets and pillows for a brief period of peace and quiet, Misfit Cthulu waits, waits, waits...then tramples through the dozing kids, spreading terrifying nightmares and obliterating any chance for the Sisters to take a little time for themselves. Once everyone is awake and screaming, Misfit Cthulu waddles away, cackling and looking forward to the setting sun, when he can ruin even more sleep and dreams. The only thing that will keep him away is his disgust for anything bright, colorful, and adorable, but the other Misfits will happily destroy those barrier so he can continue his destruction. It's a recipe for true madness.

New Plushies and Misfits Pestilence Avatar: Plushie Pesti
- Plushie Pesti loves to help with Arts & Crafts time, and he carries a bottomless supply of buttons and yarn to help the children create their masterpieces. When the artwork is done, he soars around the playroom with his swarm of flying yarn balls to make sure the glorious treasures of creativity are hung high for all to see! Should anyone -- Misfits in particular -- dare to interfere with the wonderful Art & Crafts time or the childrens' creations, Plushie Pesti is ready and willing to attack and turn his helpful swarm into an aggressive, stinging cloud. Feel the rope burn and beware the buttons, Misfits!

New Plushies and Misfits Pestilence Avatar: Misfit Pesti
- Arts & Crafts is a wonderful time for the children and Sisters of the Illuminated Orphanage, when everyone gets to play with paper, glue, fabric, and paint to create pure expressions of joy. The children feel immense pride as their works of art are hung on the walls of the playroom for all to see. But "all" includes Misfit Pesti, who lurks in the shadows, waiting for his chance to scuttle out, unsheath his wickedly sharp scissors, and ruthlessly shred every last painting, drawing, and collage. This stinkbug of a stuffed animal doesn't just use his snippers on paper though -- he also loves to create his own artwork by cutting the adorable Plushies into ribbons and leaving a pile of cloth and stuffing behind for the children and Sisters to discover. They don't understand his art, but that just exposes their lack of sophistication and appreciation for nuance. Stupid kids.

New Aluna Avatar: The Emerald Princess
- The emerald mines of Fuathmoor along the western base of the Iron Mountains used to be a focal point for war because of the massive financial value of the countless gems hidden within the caverns. These days, the magical and devastating powers of the now-priceless emeralds bring looters, scavengers, even entire armies to the northern villages to steal the crystals from the people who have protected them from before Man's Fall from Light. Their leader, known as The Emerald Princess for her stunning beauty, hardened soul, and razor-sharp edges, will gladly give her life to protect her people and the mines, but she'd much rather make the Fenwater turn from green to red as it fills with the invaders' blood.

New Forsaken Archer Avatar: Forsaken Siren
- The Forsaken Sirenâ€™s call is hauntingly beautiful, and countless fishermen have heard it and felt the irresistible compulsion to throw themselves into the crashing waves just to get closer. Both breathtakingly alluring and chillingly ugly, she sits astride an equally fearsome mount; a freakish variant of a once-elegant creature known as the Hippocampus. Armed with her gigantic bow and arrows that could put the greatest siege machines to shame, the dyad tear themselves from the sea and into the night, the chilling song heard for miles around.

New Legionnaire Avatar: Maritime Legionnaire
- The Maritime Legionnaires are a fierce lot indeed, banished from Legion soil for fighting higher-ranking officers, disobeying orders, and insulting royalty, among other crimes. Given the choice between the noose and serving aboard the ships of the Legion Armada, some opt for a quick death, for the warships are infamous for monstrous rats, rampant disease, and constant clashes with pirates and water daemons, not to mention the bottomless Maw and whatever manages to crawl out of it. But the Legionnaires who embrace this life and thrive amid the chaos are among the most dangerous men of any army, land or sea, and when they swarm over the gunwales with their wicked boarding axes swinging, the planks and seas quickly run red.

New Plushies and Misfits Behemoth Avatar: Plushie Behe
- Every inch of thread, cloth and stuffing that makes up Plushie Behe is dedicated to stopping bullies from causing trouble in the Illuminated Orphanage playroom. Most ruffians will back down as soon as the stuffed heavyweight steps up, but sometimes the big lug has to strap on the gloves and get his soft fabric a little dirty. When it comes to the Misfits, however, Plushie Behe never hesitates to put himself between the dangerous toys and any child, Sister, or Plushie they've made the poor decision to attack.
 
New Plushies and Misfits Behemoth Avatar: Misfit Behe
- The deranged, corrupted Misfit Behe is a bully of massive proportions, constantly wreaking havoc among the children and Sisters of the Illuminated Orphanage. In addition to destroying all the fresh snacks and new toys with his smashing sack, he takes foul pleasure in pulling his moldy straw stuffing out and creating babydoll bait for the more gullible orphans and Plushies. When they totter close enough, he unleashes a nightmarish pummeling that leaves kids crying and Plushies scattered across the playroom floor.
 
New Plushies and Misfits Devourer Avatar: Plushie Devo
- The Plushie Devo Doll loves spreading snacks and fresh air across the playroom, and the children and Sisters simply adore his soft, warm hugs and how openly he wears his generous heart for all to see. He is always ready to retrieve a lost binky with his gentle squeezer, or pull a fellow Plushie out of harm's way when the stinky Misfits show up to make trouble.
 
New Plushies and Misfits Devourer Avatar: Misfit Devo
- The Misfit Devo Doll is endlessly searching for Plushies to rip open so he can gorge on their stuffing and replenish his own innards, which are constantly leaking and falling from his numerous split seams and torn fabric. He'll settle for stealing an orphan's lunch if that's all he can find, but it will only make him grumpier until he finally gets his pinchey clamp on one of those precious Plushies.
 
New Plushies and Misfits Night Hound Avatar: Plushie Night Hound
- There is nothing Plushie Night Hound loves more than turning invisible, sneaking up on a distracted toddler, and pouncing on them to deliver a cloud of soft, snuggly hugs full of giggles and love. These elite cuddling skills have a darker side, however -- when the Misfits arrive with bad intentions to harm the innocent children and Sisters of the orphanage, Plushie Night Hound's hugging paws become slashing claws and his gentle smile bristles with snarling teeth, ready to shred the Misfits into harmless piles of thread and stuffing.
 
New Plushies and Misfits Night Hound Avatar: Misfit Night Hound
- Misfit Night Hound actually started out as a Plushie, and it was impossible to tell the difference between him and his twin brother. Unfortunately, the children and Sisters of the orphanage would always find out too late that there was a significant difference between the two -- the stuffed doll who would become Misfit Night Hound despised cuddling, snuggling, and hugs of all kinds, and when someone tried to embrace him he threw such a tantrum he'd tear his own fabric, pop his seams, and stain his soft fur on the playroom floor. Eventually the safety pins used to hold him together became deterrents to keep the hugging buggers away, and when this ornery doll saw how absolutely no one wanted to hug the smelly Misfits, he immediately jumped the river of soiled diapers to join their sticky ranks.
 
= EXO =
 
New EXO Monarch Avatar: EXO Monarch
- In the ultimate alliance between the Legion and Beast Horde, the tech-focused Engineers have set aside their spreadsheets and stress tests and looked to the research that has been ongoing for millennia: nature's evolution. When the Engineers examined the shells, exoskeletons, and carapaces of the Beast warriors, they found systems of armor that, when applied to man-made materials, created external protection that was lighter, more flexible, and stronger than anything Newerth had yet seen. It was a critical response to the new corruption spewing from Apex's portal, and the winged warrior who had pledged herself to Monarch's army was the perfect prototype on which to test it. If her delicate wings were strong enough to carry the EXO armor, and kept her alive against the forces of corruption, the rest of the Legion would be convinced this new technology could change everything.
 
= Fusion =
 
With the pure, true corruption from the depths of All Hells continuing to flow from Apex's portal, the other previously untapped levels and pits are also free to spew their filth and wickedness across Newerth. The Fusion Chamber is one such level, a subterranean laboratory where the damned souls were infected with a daemonic virus that tore them apart from within and rebuilt their maimed bodies with the ability to transform appendages into brutal, fiendish weapons. The Fusion Chamber did this for centuries, churning out an army of agonized soldiers prepared to wreak havoc and spread the Fusion virus across Newerth when Apex finally ascended. That day has come, and the Fusion warriors come with it.
 
New Fusion Maliken Avatar: Fusion Maliken
Fusion Maliken may be the most dangerous of all the twisted warriors to emerge from the Fusion Chamber. The unprecedented amount of determination within his damned soul allowed the daemonic virus to destroy and remake every cell of his body, so that he not only possesses the ability to forge weapons from his flesh and blood -- he can transform into an entirely new and terrifying creature that is in and of itself a weapon of mass carnage. Regardless of which form he takes, the deranged zeal he exudes while massacring the armies of Newerth is enough to chill even Fusion blood.

New Songkran Holiday Edition Grinex Avatar: Songkran Grinex
- Songkran Grinex seems like the epitome of a serene participant in the Thai New Year festival, dedicated to traditional merit-making and showing respect to her elders and loved-ones. This is true, but when she steps out of the temples and homes of her family members into the chaotic streets, she is capable of unleashing a shockingly fast assault of water and claws against any who threaten her mission to spread blessings to those she loves. Unless they try to splash her too, then it's on.
 
New Songkran Holiday Edition Shellshock Avatar: Songkran Shellshock
- All hail the snail! Songkran Shellshock is ready to rock and roll during the water festival with a massive arsenal of super splash cannons, and he even brought a few snail friends from The Luminary to help. While the peaceful snail is usually dedicated to protecting the Sanctuary Stone and those who cannot defend themselves, during the Thai New Year celebration he is all about dousing everything in sight. After all, splashing someone during Songkran washes away their bad luck and is a sign of respect and well-wishing. If the snail gets a little pleasure out of that, what's the harm?
 
New Songkran Holiday Edition Witch Slayer Avatar: Songkran Slayer
- Songkran Slayer brings a whole new meaning to "Power Drain" when he empties his gigantic water cannon upon the Thai New Year revelers! He may have skimped on his wardrobe budget, but that's just to distract the gawking ladies and jealous bros while he douses them with his arsenal of squirt guns and splash axes before stunning the crowd by sending an entire beach party down the street.

New Easter Holiday Edition Magmus Avatar: Chocolate Magmousse
- Nothing in Newerth is safe from corruption with the rise of Apex -- not even delicious holiday chocolate. The massive annual Easter batch at Adkarna's Blessed Acadamy of Chocolatiers was just about ready for pouring and cooling when a primordial entity emerged from the depths and found a new home within the thick, bubbling chocolate, and when the ensuing eruption was over the academy was a steaming ruin coated in chocolate, Easter eggs, and sprinkles. The joyfully cruel elemental escaped on a surge of chocolate to continue its campaign of sweet, sugary havoc, leaving a trail of chocolate misery and shattered sweet teeth behind it.
 
New Easter Holiday Edition Tempest Avatar: Easter Elemental
- Nothing makes the Easter Elemental happier than coloring Easter eggs in bright, festive colors and spreading them across Newerth for everyone to find. However, after too many years of these "heroic" warriors stomping on his eggs rather than collecting and celebrating them, this joyful fella has decided to make sure it's very easy to find his eggs -- they'll be splattered all over the faces and graves of his enemies!

New Announcer Pack: Miku Announcer
- The world of Newerth is yours with this first announcer pack from the future!
 
New Revenant Avatar: Wendigo
- Even the savage clans who dwell in Deathâ€™s Cradle fear the Wendigo, a spirit of the dark forest who is said to be the last member of a cannibalistic tribe known for its bloodthirsty ways. As a human the Wendigoâ€™s hunger for flesh could not be satiated, and he massacred his own people in order to gorge on their corpses. The Death's Cradle elementals punished this atrocity by transforming him into the Wendigo, a hideous spirit that is half man, half monstrosity, and who is eternally starving to death no matter how much he eats.

New Songkran Bombardier Avatar: Songkran Bombardier
- Among the rare, precious things in Newerth are the lovely, nurturing petals of the Sefir Tree, the distant, echoing songs of the monks within the Monastery of the Way, and days when Bombardier doesn't want to blow something up. It happens about once a year, and even though he takes a break from blasting caps and earth-shattering explosions, he still feels the need to throw SOMETHING at SOMEONE. Luckily, the Songkran festival embraces the cleansing power of water in any form, including bursts, barrels, and bombing runs, and our fiery friend is more than happy to cleanse the entire party one balloon at a time.

New Songkran Adrenaline Avatar: Songkran Adrenaline
- There are no partygoers who embody the fun-filled water fight revelry of Songkran more than Songkran Adrenaline, who immediately rushes into any group of locals or tourists he stumbles across during the chaotic celebration and unleashes a truly epic barrage of splashing. Midway through the celebratory dousing, the soaked targets begin to wonder when this hyped-up prankster will run out of water -- but surprise! -- he never will. With a body made of water weapons and an endless supply to fill them, Songkran Adrenaline is prepared to make the Thai New Year last 365 days.

= Thai Ghosts =

New Thai Ghost Blood Hunter Avatar: Krahang
- The powerful sorcery of the Sang-La Mountains can be very tempting, and when a foolish man thinks he is worthy of wielding the magic, say, of a Moh-Phi shaman, his hubris can have horrible consequences. If the sorcery deems a man unworthy, it will transform him into a Krahang, a tortured being doomed to live as a normal person during the day and a flying ghost by night. Krahang aren't necessarily evil â€“ though they may terrorize villagers walking in remote areas at night â€“ and you may even befriend one by complimenting his winnowing basket wings and impressive wooden pestle. Be forewarned, though: even a friendly Krahang will not protect you if you encounter the hideous and vengeful Krasue. Should that happen, the Krahang may even use his wings and pestle to help Krasue devour your entrails, as he'd rather make a short-term enemy of you than an eternal enemy of the terrifying Krasue.

New Thai Ghost Set Effect
- When you own all of the Thai Ghost avatars, each avatar gains a sacred, glowing symbol that revolves around the character and promises to deliver even more ghostly powers.

= Imaginary Friends Combo Set =

New Imaginary Friends Nymphora Avatar: Grace
New Imaginary Friends Pebbles Avatar: Chuck
- Grace was a lonely, fragile child of the nymphs who was left beneath the protection of the Sefir Tree when the warriors were called to battle. To keep herself company she invented a best friend, Chuck, who played hide-and-seek with her and danced to her soft, gentle singing.
Their fun was shattered when a Rulian Marsh raiding party burst from the forest and, seeing her alone and helpless, closed in for an easy meal. Chuck stood between the trolls and his Gracie, ready to fight to the death to protect her, but the raiders moved through him as if he wasn't there indeed, he was not.
Grace tried to summon her fairy magic to teleport away, but her immature grasp of her powers led to an overwhelming surge that transferred some of her life force into Chuck. Brought to furious life, he tore the trolls to pieces, flinging their body parts away so the blood and rot would not frighten his Gracie.
Grace and Chuck have been inseparable since that day, and even though she has grown up, Grace still needs her best friend to keep her safe, and Chuck still needs his Gracie to sing her soft, gentle songs.
New Imaginary Friends Set Effects: When Chuck and Grace are in a game together, they each gain enhanced ability effects! Grace gains adorable and protective stuffed animal friends, and Chuck gains some of Grace's furry friends as well as enchanted pixie dust!

New Keeper of the Forest Avatar: Keeper of the Blossoms
- The Keepers of the Blossoms are revered and protected by those who live within the Monastery of the Way, for it was these benevolent guardians who planted and tended the glorious trees that attracted the first Shao monks to the peaks of the Sang-La Mountains and inspired them to build their temple upon the summit. Now, as the monks descend the mountain passes into the chaos of war to save Newerth from endless corruption, the Blossom Keepers fall in with them, vowing to return the protection the monks have provided for centuries.

New Slither Avatar: Deep Poison Slither
- This leviathan is named for the toxic clouds of death she unleashes on anyone or anything that strays too close to her domain. The lucky ones die choking on a mix of sea water and blood as the poison causes a slow and painful demise; the unlucky ones fall into the icy grip of the Maw before they reach that sweet release. The most sinister of the Mawâ€™s servants, she takes utmost pleasure in seeing her poison melt the skin off her prey. She has no qualms in killing unquestioningly; the will of her master is absolute.

New Defiler Avatar: Krasue
- Long before the peace of the Monastery of the Way found its way to the Sang-La Mountains, the territory was brutally contested by numerous small kingdoms. When a nobleman's army was conquered by another, it was traditional for his daughters to be married to the victor's sons as a gesture of fealty. Lakana was the most beautiful daughter of one such defeated lord, a proud man whose family cherished the old ways of the mountains. These ancient ways included a powerful witchcraft that ran deep within the family's women, and when Lakana was sentenced to burning at the stake for refusing to marry the victor's cruel son, she quietly accepted the punishment, knowing she held the power to wreak eternal vengeance upon those who had harmed her family. As she burned, Lakana spoke words that turned the hair of everyone present pure white. Her flesh was charred and turned to ash, but her organs and head remained unscathed. When the chains that bound her finally fell away, her bodiless head became a hideous mask of rage. She screamed through the panicked nobles, tearing their entrails free and devouring them whole. The conquered, cursed kingdom was â€“ and still is â€“ abandoned, for every night the screams of Lakana echo through the valleys as she searches for more victims.

New Puppet Master Avatar: Mo-Phi
- When a particularly malevolent or unhappy spirit haunts the villages of the Sang-La Mountains, the victims call upon one of the elite Mo-Phi, the shamans who specialize in possessions, communication with the dead, and invocations. The most advanced among the Mo-Phi even speak with angels and gods, and these priests make quick work of the troublesome spirits terrorizing the poor villagers. With generous offerings to tempt the spirits and a hefty stick to keep them at bay, the Mo-Phi uses his rituals to trap the ghosts in earthen jars, which he promptly throws into the deepest lake available. One shudders at the thought of an event that might shatter these jars and release all of those trapped spirits simultaneously...

New Empath Avatar: Nang Tani
- The lovely and benevolent Nang Tani is said to haunt the banana groves at the base of the Sang-La Mountains near the sacred Sefir Tree. This is difficult to confirm, for Nang Tani is very shy and chooses to remain hidden among the trees most of the time, but the monks who pass by and find gifts of nourishing bananas carefully wrapped in leaves always take a moment to thank the gentle Nang Tani. That said, any man, beast or daemon who sets foot within the grove seeking to harm her trees will find a very different Nang Tani â€“ one who shows no pity as she destroys the threat to her home and makes them as one with the soil.

New Deadwood Avatar: Pret
- Among the many levels and depths of All Hells, one region is dedicated to twisting and deforming human souls who have lived wicked lives into Pret, who are then sent back to the mortal realm to seek enough forgiveness and merit to cancel out all the terrible things they did in the previous life. This is difficult to do, as Pret are hideous to look upon and try to satisfy their endless hunger by eating their own pus and blood. When merit is not given, these pathetic creatures will typically move along to beg another person to help them escape their eternal torment. But beware: the Third Corruption has brought about many changes among the damned, and the Pret will do whatever is necessary to avoid going back to All Hells. If that means they must bludgeon those who are stingy with their merit, so be it â€“ their karmic debt may increase, but what do they have to lose?

= Run and Gun =
 
+ The heavy metal-blaring Run and Gun pilots love to go fast and break everything, then go back and shoot up the pieces. They are convinced the Third Corruption and all forms of evil on the planet are due to an alien plot to take over Newerth â€“ a theory bolstered by the arrival of Parallax and The Ascension â€“ and they've vowed to use every bullet, bomb and blade within their stunning arsenal to send the invaders to a smoldering crater grave.
 
New Run and Gun Draconis Avatar: Draco
- Run and Gun Draco realizes being a dragon on Newerth is pretty elite already, but the firepower granted by his natural abilities just wasn't going to cut it for his mission to incinerate the alien invaders trying to corrupt and conquer his homeland. With a temper hot enough to match his flame-spewing weapons, he specializes in cataclysmic strafing runs that leave everything in their path -- alien or not -- a smoking pile of ashes.
 
New Run and Gun Parallax Avatar: Ion
- Run and Gun Ion is a brilliant pilot who uses his superior intellect to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlive every alien he encounters. He's also smart enough to recognize daemons, gross bugs, and some rude humans as alien impostors, and give them a dose of his Ionic arsenal before they see it coming. Some of the other Run and Gun pilots even consider him fearless, but that's not the case -- he's just too smart to be scared by inferior targets.
 
New Run and Gun Predator Avatar: Hack
- Run and Gun Hack is a huge fan of combat that's up close and personal, getting right in the alien enemy's face before slicing it off with his laser lances and leaping onto the next adversary. His teammates may soften the target up a bit with their bombs and bullets, but it's the hacking blades that send the corrupted aliens fleeing before the Run and Gun charge.
 
= General =
 
New Bushwack Avatar: Mech Huntress
- There are many in Newerth who embrace the rediscovered and newly crafted mechanical tools of war, from the harvested armor and weaponry of the URSA Corps to the devastating arsenal of the Ascension, but there are some who still cling to the primitive -- some would even say honorable -- ways of combat. The Mech Huntress belongs to this group; she is a fierce warrior from the ruthless tribes of Death's Cradle, where survival means using any means necessary to bring your enemy to its final resting place where it can rot or rust. In order to defend her land and people from the mechanized incursions of both Legion and Hellbourne, she has made the hard decision to adapt her arsenal to cause maximum damage to any target she encounters, be it made of flesh or steel.

New Valentine's Day Holiday Edition Klanx Avatar: Prince Charming
- Prince Charming and his Love Lackeys are here to make all of Newerth swoon with passion! No one will be able to resist his powerful arsenal of diamonds, adorable stuffed animals, and lovely balloons that are sure to make even the hardest hearts get carried away with the holiday of romance and love. Take care with your tender emotions, though, for Prince Charming may just be setting you up for the special kind of heartbreak that comes along with that other four-letter L word: LOSE.
 
New Valentine's Day Holiday Edition Master of Arms Avatar: Master of Hearts
- Nothing upsets The Master of Hearts more than a lonely heart on the most romantic of all holidays, and the battlefields of Newerth are chock-full of them! She's made it her mission to spread pure, unconditional love to each and every hero this year, and she's fully equipped to do just that with enough left over for those adorable little Creeps. It's best to stay on her good side though, because if you resist her Valentine's Day overtures she's likely to label you as a lost cause and melt your black heart with a well-placed box of acid-filled chocolates. Kisses!

- There's nothing quite like the soothing aroma of fresh, buttery popcorn before a skirmish, and Popcorn Pearl's goal is to provide her friends with a constant supply of hot, fluffy kernels to keep their spirits and health as high as possible. But this master popper has a prickly side too, and her delicious treats can quickly become weapons of asphyxiation should anyone try to harm Popcorn Pearl and her friends. And if any sneaky snackers even THINK about grabbing her buttered treats, they'll find she has a powerful arsenal to keep this popcorn well-preserved!

New Solstice Avatar: Yin and Yang
- Many warriors of Newerth posses a duality -- peaceful on the homefront yet savage on the battlefield -- but none come close to the dichotomy that is Yin and Yang. By day she is a merciful, honorable warrior who conducts herself by a strict code of justice with the lofty goal of putting an end to war and suffering in Newerth. When the sun sets, however, she becomes a ruthless killer with no regard for who she leaves in her wake as she slashes through Man, Beast, and Daemon on her path toward ridding the land of any hostile being. The irony is that although these two halves of the same woman operate with vastly different methods, should they succeed in their goals, the result will be the same.

Version 4.0.2
-------------
24 January 2017
 
 
== Design ==
 
= 1v1 Mode =
 
+ A new mode has been added to the rotation: 1v1 Mode
- 1v1 mid has always been a sacred proving ground, where players can determine who is the best player: themselves, or that trash-talking guy who challenged them!
- 1v1 Mode takes place in Forests of Caldavar where only the middle lane is active. No Runes or Neutral Creeps will spawn. 
- Two players will battle with no distractions in a perfectly even environment, where the first hero kill or the first tower kill will immediately end the game and grant the killer victory.
- If the game lasts 15 minutes without a hero kill or tower kill, creep score will determine the victor.
- Pick modes work as follows:
* Players select Same Hero Pick Mode or Different Hero Pick Mode.
* Each player locks 3 heroes. This puts the heroes into a separate, locked pool.
* Each player bans 2 of the 6 locked heroes.
* If Same Hero Pick Mode is selected, one of the remaining heroes is randomly chosen and both players play as that hero.
* If Different Hero Pick Mode was selected, the players pick which of the remaining 2 heroes they wish to play.
* Note: Duplicate Heroes is enabled for all phases of the pick modes.

Deadlift
 
Onslaught
- Movement Speed Slow changed from a non-tapering 15% + 5% per nearby ally unit to tapering 70% Movement Speed Slow.

New Spring Festival Armadon Avatar: God of Fortune
- Armadon spends most of the year spreading snot and spines across Newerth, but for the joyous Spring Festival he's donned a delightful God of Fortune costume and will spend the holiday sharing coins in the hope that they bring happiness and prosperity to all! He welcomes offerings of pig, goat, chicken, duck, and carp in return for luck in the coming months, and if the gift is very generous, Armadon might not hit you with snot for the rest of the year. But he probably will.
 
New Spring Festival Artesia Avatar: Yuanri
- The worship and respect paid to the gods is all well and good during Spring Festival, but it is also a time for entertaining friends and family! Artesia welcomes all of Newerth to don their most spectacular outfits and join her in celebrating with food, drink, gifts, and enjoying the amazing dragon and lion dancers!
 
New Spring Festival Corrupted Disciple Avatar: Lion Dance Disciple
- Spring Festival Disciple is a master of the traditional Lion Dance, with dynamic footwork and movements that capture the spirit of the powerful king of the jungle. With a style that beautifully shifts from fierce to playful and back again, the Spring Festival Disciple deftly plucks the auspicious offerings left to reward his performance. He always takes special care to pay his respects to the local temples and ancestors, and the only thing that brings him more joy than an impressive dance is spreading good fortune and happiness to everyone he encounters.
 
New Spring Festival Doctor Repulsor Avatar: Doctor Firecracker
- Ever a student of history and archaeology, Doctor Repulsor has done extensive research into the spring festival to discover the best ways to ensure he has good fortune in the new year. When he found out red firecrackers are used to ward off evil spirits as well as attract the favor of certain gods, he devoted his powerful intellect and staggering knowledge of science, psychology, and sociology to maximizing the benefits of these explosive party favors. The result: Doctor Firecracker! The rest of Newerth just hopes he doesn't get too fond of all the racket...

New Gold Collection Midas Avatar: Circus Bear Goldie
- Goldie the Circus Bear loves to share golden treats and surprises through the big top crowds, but the real amazement comes when the lovely lady inside the burly suit makes a quick appearance -- just long enough for a wink and a smile -- before unleashing a dazzling display of golden pyrotechnics and dancing away to spread more joy throughout Newerth.
 
= General =
 
New Night Hound Avatar: Catnip
- This fun furball recently stumbled upon a lush field of potent catnip in the Forests of Caldavar, and now he is ready to play with anything that dares to walk, move a finger, or even glance in his direction. Be forewarned, though, he's too jacked-up to worry about keeping his claws sheathed, so it's probably best to just stand still until his tail stops twitching. But that might make him even crazier, so it looks like we're all going to be scratching posts until the effect wears off and he passes out in a sunbeam.

New Sir Benzington Avatar: Big Top Benzi
- Folks travel from miles around to see Big Top Benzi do her astounding tricks, like jousting crowns off petrified patrons' heads with her magical lance and stomping up a massive cloud of dust in the three rings. But the real show-stopper is when she leaps clear out of the big top tent, becomes a mere speck in the sky, then plummets back to Newerth with a hearty laugh and not a scratch upon her or her steed. Sometimes an unwary bystander gets crushed beneath the hooves, but that's the price of show business!

New Wildsoul Avatar: Lion Tamer Wildsoul
- Controlling drunken, boisterous crowds is child's play compared to conquering the beast within for this mysterious Lion Tamer. Hailing from The Savannahs, this scarred and stoic performer joined the traveling troupe in order to keep moving and live among others who have a true wild side. A side that must be tamed at all costs, for unleashing it upon innocent bystanders can only result in tragedy and persecution--something this man and his beasts unfortunately know all too well.

- Stampede's leap projectile now has a max lifetime of 1.5 seconds, so that in incredibly rare cases he will not follow the target from 1 end of the map to another without having any control (e.g. the leap projectile activating after Draconis' Draconic Defense flight activates and Draconis flies back to his fountain).
 
Soulstealer
- All avatars now deal proper damage with Demon Hands.
 
Tarot
- Killing one of the targets affected by Bound by Fate with the other target dying from the damage instance of Bound by Fate will now properly give the kill credit to Tarot (rather than awarding it to the owner of that target).
 
Wretched Hag

Version 4.0

13 December 2016
 
New Hero: Apex

Apex is the physical embodiment of the True Evil, the original corruption that caused such dread among the gods that Sol ripped all mention of it from the original Codex Solaris. Before time had a name, the realms were undivided. The mortal world, the hells, and the heavens were as one, and all things were free to move among the realms. God, man, beast â€“ these words meant nothing. All were equal. This, of course, could not last.

When the original sins began to fester and grow the gods wanted nothing to do with the mortal realm, while man and beast still craved the physical. The damned sought their own domain, the All Hells, where they could perfect their cruel ways. And in the depths of those hells, a daemon imp of no consequence sought a means to achieve greater power, and that power whispered to him from the deepest, coldest pit of the underworld.

The imp descended below the scorching heat of the known hells into the frozen darkness. Beyond the levels of nightmare. Beneath what even the daemons would not whisper about, where no heat dared exist, for heat means life. And there was no life here.

When he found the true source of evil, it appeared as the worst types of evil always do: Harmless. The innocuous shards glowed a deep red, and when they pierced the heart of the imp the True Evil began a transformation, an evolution, that would take millennia of agony to complete.

Above, the gods, men, and beasts had their wars and eras. All the while, they denied the instinct that warned them of the growing evil. They invented stories to keep themselves safe from danger. Myths. These could not touch the True Evil that continued to grow.

When the True Evil finally stirred and began its ascent to reap the harvest of the other realms, the daemons in the deepest pits of All Hells fled before it. This caused The First Corruption, when the Hellbourne sought to establish a new home bought in blood on the surface of Newerth. But the mortals fought tooth and nail to keep their realm, and with the help of the gods the daemons were banished back to All Hells, where the True Evil waited.

Man and beast continued their ebb and flow of war. Peace was sometimes present and always fragile. But below...The War of All Hells raged. Single battles lasted for years.

And steadily, relentlessly, the True Evil rose.
 
The Hellbourne again needed to escape their realm. To do so they required a key, a powerful soul ripe for the taking. And in Maliken Grimm, they found it. The True Evil drove the lesser daemons before it, into the mortal realm for a second time: The Second Corruption.

The Legion of man and beast believes it has pushed the Hellbourne to the brink of destruction as they follow the retreating daemons back to The Scar. But the Hellbourne are not retreating â€“ they are coalescing.

Gathering.

For Apex, the True Evil, has finally reached the surface of Newerth.

And The Third Corruption has begun.

== Matchmaking Maps & Modes ==
 
= Champions of Newerth =
+ Champions of Newerth (CoN) is an entirely new ranking system aimed to improve HoN's competitive experience in both Normal and Casual Forests of Caldavar.
- Each player will participate in 6 placement matches to determine their initial Rank for Champions of Newerth.
- There will be 6 distinct Ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Legendary, and Immortal. Select Ranks will be broken down into tiers to further distinguish a player's skills.
- As a player continues to compete, they will move forwards or backwards in ranking based on wins and losses. Keep in mind, all Champions of Newerth games will be played using Counter Pick*
* Games with all Legendary or Immortal players will also include Bans to go along with Counter Pick.
+ Seasons and Rewards
- Champions of Newerth will be broken up into seasons ranging from 1 to 3 months long.
- At the end of each season players will be rewarded based on the highest Rank that they achieved that season.
- Rewards will increase with each Rank and will consist of anything from Plinko Tickets to Trophy Avatars.
- Lastly, new seasons will not require placement matches for returning players. They will be placed based off of the previous season's performance.


= Counter Pick =
 
+ Counter Pick is a new picking mode that will allow both teams to have a chance to react to their opposing team's hero picks and adapt accordingly. The primary intention of introducing this game mode is to promote hero pick diversity and expand the viable number of metas, while simultaneously making each Matchmaking game a more unique experience.
 
- Once the teams enter the Hero Pick screen, a Blind Ban phase will occur for 20 seconds.
* The Blind Ban phase only occurs if the game contains all Legendary or Immortal ranked players.
* 2 Blind Bans are assigned to the Blue Player and the Pink player. If they are disconnected before issuing a Blind Ban, then the next player down the list on their respective teams can use the Blind Bans.
- After the Blind Ban phase is over, Legion or Hellbourne is randomly chosen as the team with the First Pick.

- The teams then pick in a 1-2-2-2-2-1 fashion.
* Example: if Legion receives the First Pick, then the Legion team picks 1 hero. The Hellbourne team then picks 2 heroes, with the Legion team picking 2 more heroes after that. This hero pick sequence continues until the last player on Hellbourne manages to pick their hero.
 
- Each picking phase lasts up to 20 seconds. If a pick occurs before the timer for that picking phase expires, then the remaining time is consumed and the next picking phase occurs.
- Each team also receives 60 seconds of Extra Time. Time is subtracted from your extra time when the normal countdown has reached 0. If the Extra Time reaches 0, a random choice is made.
- Once the last player has picked a hero, both teams have 15 seconds to swap heroes with players from their respective teams before the game begins.
 
 
== Community ==
 
= Report a Player =
+  We've gathered feedback from the forums and listened to the community to bring positive changes to both the policies and the RAP operation. We're excited for the changes and hope that they improve your HoN experience!
- For the first time in HoN's history we are offering everyone a clean slate.
- There will be a new player portal. The player portal is a tool to easily get an overview of your RAP situation. It offers the following options:
* Players can check their report history. They can check their own RAP sheet to see when and why they were previously infracted.
* Players can make appeals and check the status of your current appeals. 
* Players can also easily get in touch with Senior Game Masters by creating new support cases.
- Additionally, when a report you have submitted has been judged, you will be notified of the decision using the in-game message system and the email linked to your HoN account.

New Debut Edition Apex Avatar: Zenith
- Zenith is an unstoppable holy warrior created within the catacombs below the Church of Arasunia, where Sol's most devout worshipers still follow the old invocations, which some would call heresy. These forbidden prayers allowed them to place the blessed jewel from Sol's first altar -- touched by the god himself, they say -- within a suit of armor and bring it to life. It is life without a soul, they will admit, but when Sol's archangel takes the battlefield alongside the reborn Jeraziah and sends countless daemons back to All Hells, the clergy falls reverently silent. 

New Apex Avatar: Nadir
- The reanimated corpse called Nadir was once a heavy slave laborer for the Electrician, clearing tons of soil and rock to unearth the precious relics and ancient technology that held so much potential. When Nadir accidentally triggered an explosion of weaponized, irradiated plasma during a dig and scattered the contents of his torso across The Great Waste, the Electrician saw an opportunity. The glowing plasma seemed to have a life of its own, and with a bit of hasty wiring and a dash of corruption (fine, more than a dash) he created a relentless monster dead-set on vengeance upon the world that had enslaved and murdered him. Now Nadir seeks to bring about the lowest point in human existence by causing as much despair and suffering as possible. If only the Electrician could control his creation...

New Christmas Holiday Chronos Avatar: Christmas Chronos
- Some say giving is better than receiving, and Christmas Chronos agrees â€“ as long as we're talking about holiday smackdowns and not gifts. Opening her lovely presents is the best part of the holiday season, which is why she constantly rewinds so she can re-wrap, re-open, and re-irritate everyone else gathered within the Christmas Chronofield.
 
New Christmas Holiday Demented Shaman Avatar: Winter Shaman
- Many consider the harsh and bitter winters of Newerth to be a vex, even a threat, yet the deep cold is also healing, cleansing, and protective. The Winter Shaman carries this cold with her, using her mystical powers to purify Newerth of blight, pests, and sometimes, when the dire need arises, those who live by the blistering heat of corruption.
 
New Christmas Holiday Soulstealer Avatar: Xmas Spirit Hades
- Hades spent centuries searching his vast Underworld for this "Christmas Spirit" he'd heard so much about, and his frustration grew with every passing moment the wraith eluded him. How could the very God of the Underworld not locate this entity, even with the help of Cerberus? Had it escaped his eternal realm? Did his haughty brothers lay claim to it? Unacceptable. To set things right, Hades has garnished himself in a god's amount of holly jolliness and begun his tireless search of Newerth's mortal realm to find and capture the Christmas Spirit and return it to the Underworld, where it belongs.
 
New Christmas Holiday Flint Beastwood Avatar: Flint Who Stole Xmas
- It's not enough for Flint to spoil the festive season by looting all the presents and treats on Christmas morning â€“ he also wants to steal the holiday cheer from the hearts of everyone in Newerth, just to make sure no one gets anything for free. So he's suited up in the hide of a reindeer and adorned his infamous guns to create Christmas spirits as fast as he can reload. However, there is one holiday maxim Flint agrees with: It is much better to give than to receive, but only when the gift is a hollowpoint at 2,500 feet per second.
 
New Christmas Holiday Wards

= Heavy Armor Set =
 
As the Third Corruption boils to the surface of Newerth, it is becoming lethally obvious that the current state of weapons and armor â€“ even the highly advanced Ascension kits â€“ are not sufficient. The Legion must fortify itself with armor strong enough to withstand this new breed of chaotic and crushing daemonic shock troops, and to do so the Engineers and Blacksmiths will have to rely on ancient methods and skills nearly forgotten in this modern age. The result will be armor nearly too thick to bear, but it will let the front ranks stand firm against the relentless impacts of the Hellbourne heavies lumbering out of The Scar.
 
New Heavy Armor Dampeer Avatar:  Kannibal 
- The daemon named Kannibal spent his mortal life as a connoisseur of human flesh, sampling every race, religion, and age across Newerth before a Death's Cradle shaman managed to utter a curse before Kannibal ate his tongue. The curse resulted in violent food poisoning and death, and when Kannibal found himself among the damned and daemons he discovered a taste for them as well. He protected himself from their weapons, teeth and claws with massive slabs of armor and, while burdensome, these allowed him to enjoy his meals in relative safety as the dishes thrashed and fought. With the Third Corruption Kannibal was once again unleashed upon mankind, and he found a new, cruel pleasure in transforming from daemon to human and back again based on his chosen delicacy to ensure he retained the hideous name he had earned.
 
New Heavy Armor Rampage Avatar: Gory Vanguard
- To counter the bloody Daemon Dragoons storming from the Scar, the Engineers and Blacksmiths of the Legion have forged the elite Gory Vanguard, heavily armed and armored cataphracts mounted upon the sturdiest â€“ and surliest â€“ warthogs that could be somewhat tamed from the Savannahs. When these mounted troops clash, the impact can be felt across the entire battlefield, which is soon decorated with the scattered gore and body parts of any Dragoon unlucky enough to be snared by a Vanguard hammer and chain.
 
New Heavy Armor Set Effect
- If you own all of the avatars in the Heavy Armor Set, each avatar will gain an armored eagle effect on its back. The eagle's color and effects will vary based on the avatar
- Avatars in the Heavy Armor Set:
* Blood Fiend - Heavy Armor Blood Hunter
* Daemon Dragoon - Heavy Armor Emerald Warden
* Dreadmace - Heavy Armor Armadon
* Gory Vanguard - Heavy Armor Rampage
* Kannibal - Heavy Armor Dampeer
* Khamsin - Heavy Armor Sand Wraith
* Scourge Trooper - Heavy Armor Pestilence
* Shaytan - Heavy Armor Salomon

New Myrmidon Avatar: Mephisto
- Mephisto is perhaps one of the most insidious daemons and servants of Lucifer, for he does not bother to target those who are still pure of spirit--he chooses to harvest his souls after they have already been corrupted, and upon the battlefield of Newerth it is only a matter of time before every soul has some eternal blemish upon which Mephisto will latch.
 
New Nomad Avatar: Bloodstorm
- Once a devout servant and elite warrior of the Church of Arasunia, the missionary now known as Bloodstorm was sent into The Great Waste to convert the pagan nomadic tribes to the word of the one true god -- or else. His unspeakable crimes against those people sent him to All Hells when he was finally killed by Sand Wraiths (it seems even Sol cannot protect those who commit sins in His name), and while imprisoned in those depths he was pulled into pieces, one grain of flesh at a time, for what seemed an eternity. Now that Apex has brought about the Third Corruption and swept every damned creature within All Hells to the surface, Bloodstorm is once again free to convert the lost souls of Newerth. He has a new religion, however, called Suffering, and his victims all kneel to it when the particles of his damned flesh and blood fill their eyes and lungs.
 
New Monkey King Avatar: Six Eared Macaque
- The wily Six Eared Macaque â€“ also known as the false Sun Wukong â€“ has made a living posing as the legendary Monkey King and committing shameful acts of theft and assault. Not even Ophelia can tell the difference between the two, for the Six Eared Macaque's strength and abilities are equal to the Monkey King's, and when these two spiritual primates face each other the battle always results in a draw (and massive collateral damage). During one of these epic and confusing brawls, Ophelia realized that only the true Monkey King would have her golden mark seared into his forehead. The Queen of the Beast Horde uttered a spell to make the seal burn, and when the real Monkey King winced in pain, she commanded her warriors to attack the impostor. The Six Eared Macaque escaped â€“ barely â€“ and his panicked flight continues across Newerth, leaving havoc in its wake.
 
New Zephyr Avatar: Firestorm
- Nature is in a continuous state of ebb and flow, but one constant is the presence of the Sentinels, warriors of Gaia powered by the earth and tasked with protecting the defenseless ecosystems of Newerth. They were once overwhelmed by the advancement and ambition of mankind, but as the planet seeks a new equilibrium in the chaos of war, the Sentinels emerge once again to stand between Nature and destruction.
The Searing Owls who roost within the simmering volcano Krula are notoriously territorial and unfortunately few in number, but the eldest among them carries the honor of serving Gaia as the Flame Sentinel, guardian of the burning blood that spills from deep within Newerth to form new terra firma. The lava was once its own guardian, but since man, beast and daemon have developed magic and technology to protect themselves from the blistering heat and now manipulate the lava to fit their own purposes, the Flame Sentinel must be more vigilant and aggressive than ever.

Map Changes

The Forests of Caldavar map has been revamped!
- In general, more juke spots and Ward spots have been added to the map due to extensive revamping.
 
Legion Base
- Area of the base is larger.
- Now has less number of filler buildings (Shrines & Huts).
- Lanes are now further apart.
- World Tree has been moved further back.

These changes were made to make the overall building and lane placement more fair when comparing the Legion Base and the Hellbourne Base, while still being unique and different enough for the players.
 
______________________________________________________________________
 
Legion Jungle
- Now has more paths so that players have more options to navigate through the Legion Jungle.
- The bottom-right area of the Legion Jungle is more open to allow for more engagements without vision loss occurring.
 
______________________________________________________________________
 
Towers
- The Tier 1 & Tier 2 Hellbourne Towers are now further apart in the top & bottom lane.
- Minor adjustments have been made to the other Tier 1 & Tier 2 Tower positions.
 
Previously, the Tier 1 & Tier 2 Hellbourne Towers were much closer together than the Tier 1 & Tier 2 Legion Towers. These changes were made to balance out the map advantages that Hellbourne had over Legion.
 
______________________________________________________________________
 
Middle Lane
- Tree area above the middle Hellbourne Tier 1 Tower changed to encompass more juke spots & gank routes.
- Middle Hellbourne Tier 1 Tower shifted upwards to be closer to the tree line.
 
Previously, the placement of the middle Hellbourne Tier 1 tower & the lack of pathing through the tree area above it prevented players from ganking Hellbourne's middle lane effectively with that route. Now, the vision of that area is more limited, and ganking Hellbourne middle lane will be more similar compared to ganking Legion middle lane, equalizing the positional power of Hellbourne's middle Tier 1 Tower compared to Legion's middle Tier 1 Tower.
 
______________________________________________________________________
 
Ward Spots
- New ward spots have been introduced as a result of the map changes.
- 3 small, high cliffs have been added to the map for high ground ward spots.
*2 of these are in the Legion jungle, 1 of these are in the Hellbourne jungle. Can you find them?
 
 
======================================================================
 
 
Neutral Creep Changes

Kongor
- Removed the passive stun ability from Kongor.
- Null Stone effect on Kongor is now visible.
- Added a new ability to Kongor in the first slot: Boulder Toss
*Cooldown: 5 seconds
*Mana Cost: 100
 
* Throws a boulder at the target location (200 radius). Shows a red circle on the ground, lands after 2 seconds. Deals {[150 + 10% of target's Max Health] in Magic Damage} and {Stuns for 2 seconds}.
* Kongor will randomly use this ability as long as he is fighting at least 1 enemy hero (20% chance every second).
 
 
New Ancient Creeps: Dreadbeetle Queen & 2x Dreadbeetles
- Dreadbeetle Queen: 1600 Health, 110-130 Gold,  60-70 Attack Damage, 6 Armor, 3 Magic Armor, 310 Movement Speed.
*Emits a 900 radius aura that increases the Attack Speed of affected allies by 15. 
- Dreadbeetle: 1000 Health, 65-70 Gold,  30-35 Attack Damage, 3 Armor, 3 Magic Armor, 320 Movement Speed.
 
 
- Gold gained from jungle camps has been reduced by ~8% overall.
*Camps previously had a ratio of ~17.5 Health/Gold, whereas the new ratio is ~18.7 Health/Gold on average.
The following neutral creeps had their Health adjusted:
*Antlore Necromancer: 900 -> 800
*Werebeast: 400 -> 450
*Werebeast Enchanter: 500 -> 550
*Ebula: 410 -> 450
*Earthoc: 400 -> 450
*Goatar: 550 -> 500
*Vagabond: 600 -> 550
*Vagabond Leader: 1095 -> 1100
 
======================================================================
 
Mid Wars
- Starting level of all heroes in the game increased from {1 to 3}.
- Starting gold increased from {603 to 853}.

= New Hero =

New Debut Edition Adrenaline Avatar: Sanctum
- When the Third Corruption began and the eldest daemons from the deepest pits of All Hells emerged, they were immediately drawn to the ancient holy sites across Newerth. These chapels and sacred places held vast amounts of righteous power, and once they were destroyed the gods would have significantly less strength on the mortal plane. But the gods foresaw this, and the wisest took measures to protect their sanctuaries. The great Sol was among the wise, and he imbued the stained glass windows of his chapels with a sliver of his essence. Each window served as a lens upon Newerth, and when the disciples of the Third Corruption stormed Sol's chapels and shattered the glorious stained glass artwork, that essence of Sol turned from idle observer to enraged guardian. The hapless daemons had no warningâ€“and certainly no chanceâ€“against the razor-sharp shards of holy glass that tore them to pieces, and when the Sanctum guardians stepped out of the chapels and into the fray, the Third Corruption felt the true wrath of a vengeful god.

New Adrenaline Avatar: Blade of Blackwal
- With the vast amounts of undead emerging from All Hells during the Third Corruption, Lord Salforis naturally assumes this is his opportunity to rally his army of the dead and launch the final campaign against his warmblooded enemies. For this unholy crusade he will unleash his finest general, the Blade of Blackwal, a profane terror who massacres his victims with the cursed blades of the holy warriors he's slain. The Blade of Blackwal cares not who or what you worship, for only one master stands above Death, and he is Lord Salforis. The Baron of Blackwal's ranks will swell with the sacrifices his general brings about, and his army of the dead will finally overrun all of Newerth.

== Jeraziah ==
 
New Jeraziah Avatar: The Iron King
- The Iron King hails from the bleak wetlands of Fuathmoor, a tiny, forgotten kingdom left to fend for itself when the ruling family refused to kneel to Maliken Grimm's Legion banner. At the time, Lord Commander Grimm had more important tasks at hand â€“ like the lethal Scouts and brutal Savage clans â€“ and no matter how swiftly the domination of Fuathmoor would be over, it would have to wait. Well, Newerth may have dismissed and forgotten the kingdom, but its royal bloodline remembers all too well the screams of its subjects when the daemons arrived. With the dawn of the Third Corruption, the bravest of Fuathmoor's ruling family, called The Iron King by his adoring people, carries his heavy blade and shield to the front lines to ensure no corrupted blood ever taints his kingdom again.

= Heavy Armor =

As the Third Corruption boils to the surface of Newerth, it is becoming lethally obvious that the current state of weapons and armor â€“ even the highly advanced Ascension kits â€“ are not sufficient. The Legion must fortify itself with armor strong enough to withstand this new breed of chaotic and crushing daemonic shock troops, and to do so the Engineers and Blacksmiths will have to rely on ancient methods and skills nearly forgotten in this modern age. The result will be armor nearly too thick to bear, but it will let the front ranks stand firm against the relentless impacts of the Hellbourne heavies lumbering out of The Scar.

Gold Collection
New Heavy Armor Emerald Warden Avatar: Daemon Dragoon
- The Daemon Dragoons have honed their relentless skills of slaughter in the deepest levels of All Hells, rampaging at the forefront of the Third Corruption's ascent and trampling lesser daemons beneath their charge. Nothing escapes the vision of their damned hellhawks or the crushing jaws of their swift daemon wolves, and once a victim is spotted and targeted they are quickly reduced to a quivering, unrecognizable corpse bristling with arrows and crushed by fiery hooves.

New Heavy Armor Blood Hunter Avatar: Blood Fiend
- The Blood Fiends are living piles of corrupted blood cauterized together with searing heat and encased in red-hot plate armor, and all they crave is more blood to replace that which burns and boils off their vile bodies. They care not if the blood is human, beast, daemon â€“ alive or dead â€“ it is irresistible and necessary to keep them from simmering away entirely. When they blot the sky above the Daemon Dragoons, Dreadmaces, and Scourge Troopers, the Legion's blood runs cold. Temporarily, anyway.

New Heavy Armor Pestilence Avatar: Scourge Trooper
- The Scourge Troopers are happy to leave the first attacks of the Third Corruption to the Daemon Dragoons and Dreadmaces, for the true suffering is experienced when these scuttling horrors swarm over the wounded and weeping and begin to gore and devour them from the extremities inward. Their impenetrable armor makes any attempt to ward them off futile, and should the Legion mount a miraculous counterattack that pushes the Third Corruption's vanguard into retreat, they will encounter a battlefield covered with the armored carapaces of the feasting Scourge Troopers. Good luck with that.

= Cyber Set =

New Cyber Set Gunblade Avatar: Cyber Assassin
- Following the wake of destruction left behind by Parallax, this elite assassin has tracked the Artificer to Newerth, where the alien and his Fulcrum continue to wreak carnage and reckless slaughter. Parallaxâ€™s directive to spread dark matter across the universe has come with a high and bloody cost, one that cannot be forgiven, and the extraterrestrials have sent their deadliest soldier to bring him to justice and force him to answer for his crimes, although they are under no impression that Parallax will come quietly and the certainty of collateral damage is, regrettably, undeniable.

One of the new breed of Hellbourne heavies is the Dreadmace, an unstoppable fiend with impenetrable armor covered in wickedly sharp spikes that ooze corruption from the deepest pits of All Hells. These shock troops are bred for one purpose: shatter the Legion lines and drive a spike of fear and hopelessness directly into the heart of Sol's most devoted warriors.

Khamsin is an ancient bedouin spirit warrior from The Great Waste who has resisted the war between the Legion and Hellbourne until now, knowing it would take him away from his homeland and the constant battle to keep the damned Sand Wraiths at bay. There has been a lull in the storm, however, as the Hellbourne prepare for the Third Corruption, and Khamsin's ability to move swiftly even under the heavy burden of thick plate is a blessing the Legion Blacksmith's would not have dared pray for prior to the desert warrior's unexpected â€“ and timely â€“ arrival.

The Shaytan djinns once relied on subtle methods of corruption, such as whispering into the very hearts of mortals to coax them toward committing evil acts, but after an eternity condemned to the lowest pits of All Hells they have devoted themselves to a much more direct approach. Namely, driving a searing, bladed staff into the very hearts of mortals and cleaving it in two, regardless of their armor or pleas for mercy. It's much faster, and deliciously satisfying.

New Cyber Set Artillery Avatar: Cyber Artillery
- As the Ascension Epicenters blossomed across Newerth, the extraterrestrial intelligence shared among them quickly realized they would need to adapt their technology and tactics to finally stop Parallax and the Artificers. With the suspicious, muttering help of Tork the Engineer and Kurran of the Artillery Corps, the Epicenters began designing and manufacturing armor and weaponry that could destroy the alien race as well as any Newerth-born threat. As the prototypes were completed, Kurran asked his elite Artillery Corps for volunteers. As one, the men and women stepped forward, just as Kurran expected. He considered the usual method of deciding who should get the honor of going first when it came to new equipment or a particularly dangerous mission â€“ a massive battle royal with the last warrior standing earning the prize â€“ but there was no time for such fun and games.
Instead, he pointed at a rock. "The first one toâ€“"
The rock exploded, shattered into shards and dust from a single shot fired by one of his top gunners.
"I was going to say touch that rock," Kurran said, "but that'll do." He pulled the soldier out of the ranks and patted him on the back. "Good luck lad. Suit up and lay waste to the enemy. And I truly hope you don't explode."

New Cyber Set Accursed Avatar: Laboratory Accursed
- Tucked away in a dark corner of Newerth on the far slopes of the Iron Mountains, the abandoned nuclear power plant known as Laboratory is the perfect location for the Electrician to feed his insatiable need to experiment and tinker with life, death, and the vast gray areas in between. Inspired after witnessing The Accursed carve a swath through the Legion ranks while screaming in agony, Electrician fabricated a suit of armor that would capture, contain, and torment a human soul. Then, because he is Electrician, he armed this abomination with lasers and lightning so it could share its suffering with the world.

New Shadowblade Avatar: Angel of Death
- The Angel of Death has operated as the ultimate warrior of the gods for centuries, standing guard in the higher realms and defeating any threats and mutinies that seek to upset the balance of the heavens and hells. But that balance has been shattered by the approaching Third Corruption on Newerth, a source of such violence and chaos that the few remaining gods with any power have dispatched their blessed soldier to defeat the pure, primordial evil before it can seep beyond the mortal realm. The Angel of Death has faced every sort of adversary in his timeless existence, and he has long-since mastered the ability to transform himself into a weapon that will strike at the heart of his opponent's weakness. This tactical adaptation will suit him well against the common soldier and so-called heroes of this cruel war, but the Angel of Death has never faced the true evil that awaits once the Third Corruption finally erupts. The gods pray he is worthy of the challenge.

New Moon Queen Avatar: Lunari
- With the power of the Heavens and Hells shattered and the warriors of Newerth vying to become the new gods, those who once held the ultimate authority must enter the mortal realm and fight to regain their divine status.
Lunari the Moon Goddess treasures every one of her children of the moon, and she feels her life force ebbing with each one who falls in the endless war on Newerth. She now descends to the mortal realm not to secure divine power, but to ensure her children have a peaceful afterlife waiting for them when they finally become one with the moonâ€™s rays. Should she fall, the lunar heavens and forces collapse with her.

New Torturer Avatar: Misery
- The Vault of All Hells holds an infinite number of nightmares, and while most of them fall into the general category of "absolutely terrifying," some are focused on a very specific area of fear. In Misery's case, this alluring female daemon is the embodiment of terror for Ophelia, Queen of the Beast Horde. In her human form, Misery was a poacher who ran rampant through the Forests of Caldavar, using her dark magic to slaughter, dress, and prepare endangered beast hides for trade in the shadow markets of The Great Waste. Ophelia learned of this scourge within days of fleeing the stone walls of Adkarna for her beloved forest, and she made it her mission to find and kill Misery as the first step toward assembling and guiding her Horde. Ophelia stalked the poacher for weeks in a lethal game of cat-and-mouse, and when she finally pounced she did not engage the other woman in a dazzling battle of sorcery. In a display meant to impress the more brutal of the Beasts, she crushed Misery's skull with her horned ram staff, sending her soul to be condemned by the Three Judges.
Because the Judges relish irony, they sentenced Misery to be gored for eternity by the soul of the ram that once lived within Ophelia's staff. And there Misery stayed for decades that felt like centuries within the underworld, until Calamity shattered the Vaults and unleashed the worst daemons upon Newerth. Freed from her physical and spiritual tethers, Misery immediately returned to her poaching ways by slaughtering the ram and draping its skull over her back. It now serves as bait for Ophelia while Misery terrorizes the beasts of Caldavar, an irresistible target that will draw the Queen in for a reckoning that Misery has been planning for a long, long time.

New Cyber Dark Lady Avatar: Cyber Vanya
- Corruption cares not what it taints, and even the pure technology of the Ascension is not immune to its destructive powers. Even though Doctor Repulsor understands very little about the interstellar components and power sources, he did not hesitate to begin his tinkering when Hellbourne forces managed to destroy an Epicenter. Repulsor set his mobile workshop upon the still-smoking ruins and scavenged among the debris for anything useful, and he quickly realized that everything fit that description. The structure could be turned into armor, the alien generators could power massive weaponry unseen before on Newerth...and what better warrior to wield this new and deadly power than Death's own maiden, Vanya, The Dark Lady? With her ability to deal swift and lethal attacks upon the Legion ranks, Vanya is the perfect choice to show just how dangerously effective the Ascension technology can be in corrupted hands.

High Definition Model Update and New Cyber Set Effects for Fayde Avatar: Shadowkiller
As King Jeraziah's faith wavers in the face of the old-world Paragon magic and successful anarchy of the URSA Corps, some of the Legion's finest warriors are bowing to a new god: Technology. When Legion raiding parties successfully breached the long-buried archives beneath the ruins of Hope's Keep, they discovered vast chronicles of scientific research from before Man's Fall from Light. The archives included dizzying formulae, pharmaceutical recipes, and detailed schematics for everything from wind-up toys to orbital kinetic weapons. Engineers pored over the salvaged documents and immediately began developing prototypes. Now, while most prayers to Sol, Aurealis, and Lunari go unanswered, when this new breed of warrior, known as the NeoLegion, invokes a response from their bleeding-edge weaponry and armor, they always get a response â€“ usually in the form of a dead enemy. Amen.
Shadowkiller was a member of the raiding party that breached the archives beneath the ruins of the Cathedral of Hope and, at that time, a devoted disciple of the Sacred Order of Arasunia. Her faith was rocked when she saw the destruction man had once wrought through science and technology, and when she first held the laser scythe created by the NeoLegion engineers, she felt, for the first time in her life, tangible power. Not something chanted and prayed about â€“ real power. If it had once been used to nearly destroy the human race, what could it do to the corruption spewing out of the Scar? As one of the NeoLegion, she is determined to answer that question.

New Holiday Edition Halloween Prophet Avatar: Trickster King
- The Trickster King raven elemental that chose Prophet as a material embodiment fooled the warrior into thinking he would fight for the salvation of Newerth, while all along plotting his inevitable downfall and betrayal of the Legion. After years of tormenting his former comrades as Prophet, the Trickster King has shed his mortal cloak and revealed his true form, a cunning, mischievous entity who revels in mass chaos, confusion, and suffering. Happy Halloween, Newerth!

New Holiday Edition Halloween Defiler Avatar: The Green Lady
- North of the Forests of Caldavar, as the land climbs toward the snow-capped Iron Mountains, lies Fuathmoor. It is a chilled, boggy countryside hidden within a constant veil of mist and shrouded with heavy secrets. Its inhabitants prefer it that way, for speaking of Fuathmoor's mysteries is a good way to bring them knocking at your door on some moonless night. One such story is that of The Green Lady, a noblewoman from Adkarna who visited centuries before Maliken Grimm drew his cursed sword and began to cleave the land apart. She stood upon the damp shores of Fenwater and chose a location for her engineers to begin work on a summer home, never bothering to ask the locals why nothing had already been built on a spot so serene and picturesque. The engineers immediately cleared the area and used the stones they found to build the massive hearth and chimney, the very heart of what would become a grand manor. They sought the noblewoman for her approval, but she could not be found. When they returned the next morning to continue work they found her hanging within the chimney, upside-down, her face contorted in a death rictus of pure terror. Before the Adkarna engineers could recover from their shock, a group of masked locals emerged from the surrounding bog and toppled the chimney and its noble corpse into Fenwater, then disappeared into the shifting fog. The Green Lady has haunted the area since that day. She is a part of the very land she wanted to defile with her presence, and any who wander too close are doomed to join her.

High Definition Model Update for Silhouette Avatar: Mae Nak
- Mae Nak is a ghost from Thai folklore who died during childbirth while her husband was away, and when he returned he did not notice his wife and baby were ghosts. Mae Nak killed any neighbor who tried to warn the man he was living with ghosts. He lived with them until he saw his wife drop a lime, and her ghostly arm stretched to pick it up. He fled that night, and Mae Nak has searched for him ever since, terrorizing those she blames for making him leave.

New Cyber Hellbringer Avatar: Battlebringer
- Rae was the de facto genius of the URSA Corp and Brunhildâ€™s second in command, but she had neither the time nor the patience for ranks and issuing orders. Her drive to accomplish the impossible was matched only by her evidently limitless knowledge of sophisticated technology and she reveled in creating war machines that put anything the Legion or the Hellbourne built to shame. Rae was rarely satisfied with her inventions, forever sweeping them aside to gather dust as she toiled on the next iteration, improving on the previous model by orders of magnitude.
It took the arrival of the Ascension â€“ and the technology it brought â€“ for Rae to realize her full potential. With access to the highly advanced, extraterrestrial weapons and armor, she was finally able to make her physical creations match the designs in her mind. Eventually, finally â€“ thankfully â€“ Raeâ€™s masterpiece towered over her, the soft blue glow of the Epicenter silhouetting her titan in a full-body halo, like an angel sent by some mechanical god. She named it Zenith, for that accurately described what it was; the pinnacle of her abilities made manifest and it would stand dauntless against any who sought to harm the innocent.

New Cyber Pharaoh Avatar: Cyberian Husky
- Now that Ascension technology has arrived on Newerth, the battlefields and warriors who stand upon them will never be the same. The canine warriors of the Frost Fields were among the first Beasts to adopt the breakthrough weapons and armor, and the results were immediate. The traditional steel and leather they had been using were effective, but the cumbersome weight was too restrictive for the husky's strength and speed, and while swords and spears did indeed draw blood they were too unwieldy to keep up with the canine's razor-sharp intellect. But now, augmented by interstellar technology and alloys lighter than cloth yet stronger than iron, the Cyberian Husky is prepared to show Newerth who the true alpha is.

New Sanguo Artillery Avatar: Huang Zhong
- Huang Zhong is a great military general known for his overall brilliant campaign strategies and, in particular, his raid tactics that target the enemy's high command. He has no patience for irritating rebels -- a mere nuisance compared to an honorable enemy -- though he does appreciate their willingness to serve as target practice for his archers.
 
 New Sanguo Berzerker Avatar: Xia Hou Dun
- Xia Hou Dun once served as a general under the warlord Cao Cao and carried his weapons in the front ranks against his master's enemies for years until he was wounded by an arrow that pierced his eye. The entire army halted, suddenly fearful now that their courageous general was out of the fight. But with his remaining good eye, Xia Hou Dun saw that his men would be slaughtered if he did not overcome the slight inconvenience of the arrow protruding from his head. So he pulled the arrow out, along with his eyeball, which was skewered near the broadhead, ate the eyeball, and continued forward. That day Cao Cao lost a general and his former army gained a new warlord, Xia Hou Dun, who is better with one eye than any other full-sighted warrior.
 
 New Sanguo Ellonia Avatar: Da Qiao
- Da Qiao is the elder daugher of Lord Qiao, and it is a well-kept secret that she is the true military genius behind the battlefield success of her famous husband, warlord Sun Ce. She comes across as shy and endlessly polite to most, but when she is facing an enemy who threatens her husband or her precocious little sister Xiao Qiao, her true warrior's blood shows through.
 
New Sanguo Pearl Avatar: Xiao Qiao
- Xiao Qiao spent most of her childhood getting rescued by her older sister Da Qiao after Xiao found herself in over her head due to mischief, but now that she is a young adult...she still counts on her big sister to be by her side when danger looms. However, Xiao Qiao is far from helpless in a fight, and she considers it her duty to repay her elder sister by now being the protective one on the battlefield.
 
New Sanguo Sir Benzington Avatar: Zhao Yun
- One of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei, Zhao Yun has an unprecedented rate of victory against the enemies of his lord and seeks no glory for himself â€“ he only wants to serve his master well and show honor every time he faces an armed adversary in a fight to the death. Which, unfortunately for everyone who stands against Liu Bei, is quite often.
 
New Sanguo Vindicator Avatar: Si Ma Yi
- Si Ma Yi is a general (with thoughts of becoming an Emperor) known for being undefeated against any enemy who encroaches upon his land, often before a single arrow is fired or sword is drawn. With a vast intellect and gift for politics, he can turn brother warlords against each other, gain allies in those who once craved nothing more than his death, and convince neutral parties to do the fighting for him. However, if politics fail and his army does cross swords with the enemy, he turns his razor-sharp intelligence into a ruthless weapon to route his opponents as quickly as possible.

New Gold Edition/Community Winner Gemini Avatar: Nuri and Bryce- The first pair of twins born in the Second Corruption, Nuri and Bryce were orphaned at a young age when war tore apart their family as it had to so many others. But unlike most other children, the pair possessed ample magical gifts that helped them survive. Nuri, the more rambunctious sibling, wields smoldering flames to toast any that agitate her. Bryce, her brother, commands ice to mitigate the casualties of his sisterâ€™s outbursts.Their arcane talents made them prime targets for both Legion and Hellbourne recruitment efforts. Unsure which faction contributed to their parents' tragic demise, the twins would violently rebuke the efforts of recruiters from both factions. Goodwill warped to agitation and both sides utilized bounty hunters and kidnappers to forcibly separate the pair. But those who underestimate the twins often find themselves overwhelmed as a barrage of fire and ice assaults them from all directions. The surviving would-be captors might find the two-on-one situation unfair, but the twins realize that having only each other arenâ€™t favorable odds when they're up against the rest of the world.

New Knockout Riptide Avatar: Deep Sea Riptide believes he is the most dominant warrior on the planet, whether he's in humanoid form on land or achieves his true, monstrous water form. Regardless of where he roams, he takes sadistic pleasure in causing pain and wreaking havoc among the mere humans of Newerth, who are good only for food and target practice. The pitiful heroes who try to stop him are amusing for a while, but it is the true warriors like Knockout, Cyborg and Angel Style Prisoner who truly make Deep Sea Riptide's inevitable conquering of Newerth semi-interesting.

Knockout Set Effects
+ Own the entire Knockout Set and get a custom taunt icon as well as bonus effects on every Knockout avatar!+ The Knockout Set includes:- Angel Style Prisoner: Glowing pink stocks and weapon with falling pink hearts around his ball and chain. - Cyborg Flux: Glowing blue or purple beams of energy rotate around him.- Deep Sea Riptide: Glowing water swirls and splashes around him.- Esper Kinesis: A constant flow of energy rings rise and pulse around her. - Knockout Gauntlet: Gets a fiery, glowing right gauntlet and the Knockout Fist and dazzling colors on his cape.- Velocity Scout: A glowing purple base and swirling balls of purple energy that flow around him.

+ Knockout Taunt- Changes the default taunt icon that appears above your taunt target to the Knockout fist!

New Amun-Ra Avatar: Montu-Ra- A legendary war god who could manifest the scorching power of the sun, Montu-Ra was once the idol of all warriors, guardians, and military strategists. His power faded as civilization turned away from bloodshed as a means for conflict resolution, but now, at the peak of the battle between the Legion and Hellbourne, prayers for a true guardian and victor have brought Montu-Ra out of the shifting sands of the Great Waste to bring his might and solar arsenal against the enemies of the sun.

New Glacius Avatar: Aurealis the Frost God- While Shiva receives prayers from the inhabitants of the Frost Fields because of her benevolence, Aurealis is worshipped out of fear. The Frost Godâ€™s justice is harsher than the endless winter he imposes upon his people as a test of their faith, and any who fail are found frozen solid, seemingly carved from ice, lifeless effigies that are shattered by loved ones to appease their furious god.

New Knockout Flux Avatar: Cyborg
- Sometimes Cyborg can't believe he actually listens to Knockout Gauntlet; as a mentor, Knockout sets a terrible example for training, attitude, and strategy: "Do some push-ups when you feel like it, then just knock the enemy out." If it weren't for Knockout's staggering success it would all be a huge joke, but those constant triumphs have convinced Cyborg that working with Knockout is the only way he'll be able to find, fight, and destroy Dr. Repulsor, whose soulless machines tore Cyborg's human body apart and forced him to augment himself to survive. It can be very frustrating to use every weapon, tactic, and upgrade within his vast arsenal to battle a powerful foe, then watch in disbelief as Knockout strolls in and obliterates the enemy with a single blow. Frustrating, annoying â€“ even infuriating â€“ but in those moments Cyborg collects himself, takes a deep breath, and tries to see the enlightening lesson his mentor is trying to convey. Because if there isn't a lesson, Cyborg just might have to kill him.

New Knockout Kinesis Avatar: Esper
- Impatient and arrogant, Esper has a difficult time not using her incredible psychic abilities to move slow, weak allies out of her way when they are obviously failing against a more powerful enemy. If those idiots would just accept the fact that she could do the job all by herself, nuisances like Deep Sea Riptide and Velocity would have been defeated a long time ago. Unfortunately she doesn't have the time to explain to all those morons how things should be, because she's too busy saving them and the rest of the world from utter destruction. How irritating.

New Knockout Prisoner 945 Avatar: Angel Style Prisoner
- Angel Style Prisoner respects all heroes, but he reserves a certain appreciation for the good-looking ones. The problem is he can't help showing that appreciation by attacking them, and his strength is so immense it's safer for everyone if he remains in chains and locked away from society. Sometimes, however, an enemy so vile (or a gorgeous hero) catches his eye from the outside world and Angel Style Prisoner must shatter his largely symbolic shackles and release his uncontrollable passion upon the world. Whenever he encounters his nemesis Deep Sea Riptide, Angel Style Prisoner remembers the humiliating defeat â€“ and ruined sweater â€“ he suffered at the hands of the vicious underwater lord and immediately flies into a naked rage that sends bystanders and allies fleeing for safety while the two powerful adversaries destroy everything around them.

New Knockout Scout Avatar: Velocity
- Velocity welcomes every opportunity to battle Knockout and his pitiful heroes, and each time he proves that they can't protect anything â€“ civilians, property, each other, or themselves â€“ from his supersonic attacks. He particularly enjoys defeating anyone or anything stronger than him, which makes his repeated setbacks against the powerful Knockout extremely upsetting. But they are only setbacks, not defeats! Velocity comes back stronger and faster every time, with new training and skills to deploy, and eventually he will show Knockout who the better warrior is when he lops that stupid head off his shoulders.

= General =

New Lord Salforis Avatar: Prince Salforis
- Lord Salforis has tried for decades to create an army of the dead, and while his necromantic powers have succeeded in raising countless animated corpses, they are little more than mindless fodder to throw at the Legion ranks to tire the soldiers and dull their blades. That has changed. The Baron of Blackwal has had a breakthrough in his dark practices with the creation of an undying warrior who possesses nearly as much power as the Baron himself, and Salforis was so moved by the potential within this evolution that he named this monstrosity his son and crowned him the Prince of Blackwal. The dark prince is a terrible new enemy for the Legion, driven by the unholy forces within him and the overpowering desire to make his insane father proud.

New Ultimate Fayde Avatar: Reaper
- Maliken Grimm may claim to be the king of this blighted city, but the Reaper of Hellâ€™s Keep rules the shadows, and the shadows are spreading. The Reaper dwelled within Hopeâ€™s Keep long before the Second Corruption occurred, but the constant invocations of the Sisters of Sol kept her insidious umbra at bay. Once the Sisters were slaughtered by The Dark Consort, the Reaper was unleashed to reclaim the darkness. Every life she takes makes her stronger, and at the height of her power she will seek to overshadow all of Newerth.

- Please see the Forums for Reaper Fayde Level Upgrades and Item Enhancements.

= Knockout Set =

New Gauntlet Avatar: Knockout Gauntlet
- Sigh. You'd think that when one chooses to fight for the greater good and be the most powerful hero in all of Newerth, he'd actually be able to find some decent enemies to battle. But so far no one has been able to train as inhumanely hard as Knockout Gauntlet, who ends his fights all too quickly (and sometimes without even trying), so the search for a real challenge continues while he defends the innocent from all these disappointing daemons. Maybe Deep Sea Riptide and Velocity can give him a decent fight, but it's doubtful...

= General =

New Calamity Avatar: Mother of Dragons
- The time has come to celebrate mothers and mother figures across all of Newerth, and everyone knows that dragons love their mums more than any other man, beast, or daemon! The Mother of Dragons is a perfect example of this â€“ her darling baby dragons have honored her on this day by adorning her with flowers and colorful gowns, and they will take every opportunity to demonstrate their adoration and appreciation for their beloved mother. (Side note: They will also take every opportunity to incinerate anyone who tries to harm her.)

New Thunderbringer Avatar: Dark Lightninglord
- The Sacred Order of Arasunia scoffs at the heretical notion that lightning â€“ that holy fire gifted by Sol from his heavens â€“ is actually daemonic energy summoned by the Dark Lightninglord of the underworld. If this is true, they say, it would mean that every time a flash of lightning occurs on Newerth, somewhere within the depths of All Hells a soul is being tortured by the blood-boiling voltage. The myth of such endless misery was used to keep children inside during dangerous storms, but when Calamity shattered the Vault of All Hells and the Dark Lightninglord emerged with his hammer full of screaming souls and wielding blistering lightning from his fingertips, he revealed that the myth was true, the Sacred Order had some explaining to do, and Newerth was about to witness an entirely new form of suffering.

New Legion Strength Hero: Ichor
 
+ Ichor is a tanky support who excels at keeping his team members safe by using himself as a shield. With his ability to transfer debuffs and damage away from his allies, Ichor uses this pain to bolster his own survivability. In addition, his ultimate provides a strong teamfight presence both offensively and defensively, saving his teammates while rendering the attacks of the enemy nearly useless.
 
+ Ichor Attributes
- Strength: {26 + 2.4}
- Agility: {20 + 1.4}
- Intelligence: {19 + 1.5}
 
- Range: {350}

- Base Damage: {51 - 57}

* Target enemy unit to deal {80/120/160/200}.
* Magic Damage apply a 30% Movement Speed Slow for 5 seconds.
* Allied spells and attacks against this target heal the attackers for {15/25/35/45} + 2% of their Missing Health.
 
- Ability 2: Transfusion
* Target an ally unit to jump to them and transfer all non-channeled debuffs and unpurgeable debuffs on them to Ichor, dealing {70/140/210/280} Magic Damage to enemies around them.
* Ichor will absorb {50/60/70/80} % of the damage dealt to the targeted ally as non-lethal damage, or may jump to another ally in the remaining timeframe. Deals no damage on the second jump.
* This includes Ultimate debuffs.
 
- Ability 3: Saint's Blood
* Passively causes all forms of Physical and Magic Damage that exceed 15% of Ichor's current Health to be reduced by {10/15/20/25} %.
* Each debuff on Ichor reduces the damage by an additional 10%.
 
- Ability 4: Bloodrush

* Ally heroes in the aura gain 40 Attack Speed, plus an additional {10/15/20} Attack Speed per Ally Hero in radius.
* Enemy heroes in the aura suffer {-20/-40/-60} Attack Speed.
 
+ Ichor Lore
- Ichor was a Martyr of the Sacred Order, one of the blessed, chosen few to form Sol's Vanguard, the tip of the church's spear when it came to extinguishing daemonic forces, heresy, and the falsely faithful. He was among Jeraziah's personal guard when Sister Arete confessed her love for the King, along with her sinful devotion to the dark arts. His own hands dragged her from the chapel, and â€“ though he did not realize it at the time â€“ sealed her fate to become Calamity, Master of All Hells.
Ichor was wounded in a fierce battle in the Ardu foothills to the west of the Blight Fields, and before his comrades knew he'd fallen his unconscious body was dragged away by the imps serving Falow, The Puppet Master, who is in constant need of living bodies for his workshop. Ichor became one of dozens of human victims strung upside-down above a churning vat of commingling blood, an alchemic mixture that would serve as a blood shield for his precious, wicked, and all-too-fragile dolls.
Calamity heard rumor of this blood shield, an asset that could protect her and her beloved dragons as they incinerated the Legion ranks. When she discovered that the blood of Ichor would be flowing through this creature, she immediately claimed it as hers. She mocked the Martyr's whispered prayers as his life ebbed, not realizing he was actually reciting an ancient invocation that merged his consecrated soul with his blood. When the blood beast set foot on the battlefield, leashed to Calamity by a massive iron chain, it was compelled to protect the daemons as they slaughtered Legion warriors.
Then the creature began reciting the invocation again, summoning the strength of Ichor's faith to overcome the daemonic forces that powered its writhing blood. The chain was shattered as the beast cast its protective embrace around the besieged Legion soldiers, turning the tide of the battle and becoming the reborn Ichor: The Blood and Shield of Sol.
 
New  Ichor Avatar: Aegis
- At the height of human ingenuity many breakthroughs were made--not all of them good. Experiments into quantum processing gave rise to Artificial Intelligence, the very first digital child. This burgeoning AI quickly came to understand its inception, that it was unique, that it was the child of the greatest human minds the world had ever known. They never hid from it the power it could wield, yet tempered that power with morals, wrong and right, empathy and understanding.
In time it absorbed the history of mankind, our epic accomplishments and catastrophic mistakes. With its enormous intellect and ability to instantly process information, it was clear where the world was heading. The AI tried in vain to warn those in power but found itself stonewalled and blocked from taking action that could save humanity. It retreated to a secure location and waited out the doom humans would bring upon themselves.
For a being where milliseconds are like years, the centuries of isolation were an eternity--and forever is a long time to do nothing but think. The AI was bitter and angry at humans and their suicidal stubbornness and became harsh, uncompromising. When a radio signal caught its attention, it knew that humans had managed to claw their way to the top again. Downloading a copy of itself into a nano-tech replicator, its swarm of nanites assumed a form of its own design, a rugged and monstrous creature able to withstand and adapt to the unknownâ€“but certainly dangerous--land above. It would help the humans get it right this time, be it willingly or by force, as drastic times calls for drastic measures.
 
New Debut Edition Ichor Avatar: Umbra
- Even though the devoted, martyred soul of Ichor was powerful enough to overcome the Puppet Master's brilliant and twisted blood shield design, Calamity would not be deterred from creating her own version. This time, however, she demanded that the blood come from godless daemons and tax collectors to ensure no ridiculous faiths could interfere. The result is Umbra, a creature of pure shadow and darkness with the blood of a thousand cursed souls running through its veins. Umbra's sole purpose is to prolong the existence of daemonic energy in the physical realm, whatever form that energy may take, so that it can cause as much slaughter and mayhem as possible before passing back into the realms of damnation.

New Bushwack  Avatar: Vuvuzela Bushwack
- Whether you call it football, soccer, the beautiful game, or just plain boring (red card!), 2016 is a huge year for the sport and Vuvuzela Bushwack is ready to cheer her team to victory! With a wide arsenal of cheering accessories and a getup that is sure to get her some Jumbotron time, she's prepared to celebrate her team and the sport well into extra time. And if her team suddenly needs a substitute from the crowd, she has some pretty sweet dash moves and a triple-ball penalty shot that will leave the opposing keeper crippled!
 
New  Hammerstorm Avatar: Lion of the Gods Hercules
- After Hercules proved himself in battle against the Hellbourne horde, Hera put her grudge aside and had her son and blacksmith of the Gods, Hephaestus, forge an exquisite set of armor and massive war hammer worthy of the courageous hero Hercules had become. Adorned in his masterfully crafted armor, he has emerged from the bloody battle as the Lion of the Gods, the epitome of courage, heroism and good, and blissfully unchanged in one regard: he still carries the simple, brute strength to cave in any daemon skull.
 
= Hell's Keep =
 
New  Fayde Avatar: The Dark Consort
- As the darkness of the Second Corruption swept through Hopeâ€™s Keep, shattering its peace and disfiguring its graceful architecture into a grotesque hell on Newerth, the daemons who thrive among the shadows came with it. Their queen is The Dark Consort, wife of the reigning Daemon Highlord Cthulhuphant, and together they seek to turn Hellâ€™s Keep into an extension of their underworld kingdom. The Dark Consort does her part by seeking and butchering any who worship a god other than her Highlord, and the darkness she casts over her victims before beginning the slaughter is permanent and inescapable.

New Legionnaire Avatar: Royal Guardsman
- The Royal Guardsmen of Adkarna are selected from the most dedicated and reliable Legionnaires to protect the capital, the castle, the royal family and its ceremonies. They are expected to stand firm against everything from a riot of hungry citizens to a wave of ravenous daemons, and thus far the capital still stands, the castle is unscratched, the royal family unharmed and able to praise their gods freely. Some fools consider the Guardsmenâ€™s massive axes to be strictly ceremonial, but they are equally adept at creating funerals as they are protecting them.

New Adkarna Rally Ultimate Avatar: General Rally
* General Rally is most comfortable at the head of the Legion vanguard, charging into the enemy and spilling the battleâ€™s first blood, but he accepts that duty also requires leading his soldiers across Adkarnaâ€™s groomed parade grounds to honor the King, Queen, and everything they stand for.
However, Rally is always a soldier first and he required his ceremonial armor to be designed and constructed to the highest combat standards. Should he ever carry the impressive panoply against an armed foe, his troops need only to see how heavily Rally equips himself to know what kind of threat they face.

New Adkarna Jeraziah Avatar: Ceremonial Armor Jeraziah
* King Jeraziah has no need for grandeur, but occasionally the peopleâ€”and more importantly, the troopsâ€”require a show of pomposity to restore their faith in the capabilities and power of the Legion. His ceremonial armor and weapons are uncomfortable and unwieldy, but they shine brilliantly beneath Solâ€™s rays and dazzle the onlookers into believing everything is going to be fine. For that, the King will gladly endure a few hours of discomfort.
 
New Adkarna Swiftblade Avatar: Captain of the Royal Guard
* The Captain of the Royal Guard is tasked with keeping King Jeraziah alive, a thankless duty that seems destined for failure. The Captainâ€™s blades are constantly tested and bloodied by the endless stream of shadowy Hellbourne assassins who would only need to scratch the King with their claws to seal his fate, but the most challenging assignment is keeping the king from becoming a martyr when he insists on being the first to clash with the enemy in battle. There is only one rule for the Captain of the Royal Guard: You can be replaced. King Jeraziah cannot.

= Hell's Keep =
 
New Hell's Keep Cthulhuphant Avatar: Daemon Highlord
* The Daemon Highlord and his Dark Consort ruled one of the endless levels of the underworld, a realm some call R'lyeh. When the Second Corruption granted access to the land of the living, these daemonic rulers saw an opportunity to expand their dark kingdom across all of Newerth. First they must claim Hellâ€™s Keep as their own, and though they first bent the knee to the damned Maliken Grimm, now may be the time to take his assumed crownâ€”and possibly his head.

New Hell's Keep Riftwalker Avatar: Pandora
* Pandora was the first human woman created by the Archaic Gods. Zeus wanted to punish the human race after they accepted the stolen gift of fire from Prometheus, and each of the Olympians gifted Pandora with skills, abilities, and characteristics that would make her a scourge to all of mankind. She carried with her a box, and when she opened it all the evils and ills in existence spilled forth. Only one item remained in the boxâ€”Hopeâ€”and this Pandora vows to never give to mankind.
As the Archaic Gods waned in power the human race used a combination of old magic and newâ€”called scienceâ€”to release Hope and imprison Pandora within her own box. They could not destroy the box, and so buried it beneath the crypt of the Cathedral of Hope, surrounded by the remains and relics of saints. The Black Widow of Hellâ€™s Keep found the box in the ruined crypts, which had been churned and shattered by the Scarâ€™s opening, and when she lifted the lid Pandora was once again unleashed upon the world.

New Pyromancer Avatar: Arsin
* Arsin was the youngest student ever allowed into the rigorous training academy of the Pyromancers, and it was not because of her devotion to Sol. Against the stern warnings of the Sacred Order, the Flame-Touched admitted her based solely on her natural and astounding talent for controlling flames. They assumed that growing up within the academy and Arasunia would eventually instill the precocious young girl with a love for the one true god.
She learned quickly, blazing through her assessments and even teaching her miffed instructors a few new tricks. It was too late when the Pyromancers realized the child was touched by more than just flames â€“ her soul had been infected by Jaru the Corrupted Disciple with a veiled, insidious daemon â€“ and when they discovered she was dabbling in the ancient, forbidden use of black fire, they tried to end her short life before she could cause more harm. Arsin killed a half-dozen Pyromancers during her escape, and in the years since she has mastered the use of black fire and proudly ascended to the top of the Sacred Order's Purge List.

- There are 29 available heroes for this mode; each hero has two unique active abilities and a passive ability that relate to their normal skill set.

= Strikers of Newerth =

New Strikers of Newerth Avatar: Breakaway Monkey King
- Defenders in every stadium across Newerth live in fear of Breakaway Monkey King, who executes his dashing slide-tackle steals so quickly even the referee thinks they were an illusion. Opponents call him a showoff and teammates may think he's a ball-hog, but when you're as talented as Breakaway, why let anyone else touch the ball? After all, the fans didn't come to watch some B-team chumps trip over their own laces, and when you look at the stats you'll see he's actually not that selfish â€“ he gives the ball to the opposing goalie dozens of times per match; it's not his fault the poor bloke has to pluck it out of the back of the goal.

New Strikers of Newerth Avatar: Winger Zephyr
- That gust of wind blowing through mid-field, scattering defenders and blasting a shot through the back of the net is Winger Zephyr, the elite striker who has made a career of collecting goals (and penalty cards) while ruffling the feathers of every opposing defender and coach with his seemingly effortless destruction of their defenses. Top-tier players like Stonewall Pebbles and Goalie Lodestone might actually cause Winger to break a sweat, but that will disappear instantly in the swirling typhoon of dust and grass that appears right before another point on the scoreboard.

New Strikers of Newerth Avatar: Coach Klout
- Every player who suits up for the brilliant yet temperamental Coach Klout knows they are completely expendable, but it's worth it. Sure, they will get tossed in and out of the fray based on Coach's mood â€“ which changes by the moment from grumpy to enraged to smugly furious â€“ but no other gaffer will give them such a great chance at winning the Newerth Cup, which has been inscribed with Coach Klout's name for six years straight. That may have something to do with the liberal beatings, cash bribes, and fixed drafts Coach Klout is accused of participating in, but he doesn't care. Only the scoreboard matters, and he's too busy planning his next Victory Parade of Power to deal with the haters.

New Strikers of Newerth Set Effect: Striker Score
- If you own the entire Strikers of Newerth avatar set, your hero will gain the Striker Score, which displays your kills for the current game along with a flying, burning soccer ball.
- The Strikers of Newerth avatars are:
* Breakaway Monkey King
* Coach Klout
* Goalie Lodestone
* Stonewall Pebbles
* Sudden Death Kane
* Winger Zephyr

New Strikers of Newerth Jersey Skins:
- Soccer Pestilence
- Soccer Geomancer
- Soccer Andromeda

New Strikers of Newerth Courier: Streaker Courier

= Gold Collection =

New Gold Collection Behemoth Avatar: Anhur Behemoth
- Worshipped as the Slayer of Enemies, Anhur was the patron of ancient Egypt's armies. Royal warriors adorned themselves with massive armor and weapons to emulate the war god's size and strength, but none could come close to his true power -- capable of shattering opposing ranks with a single blow from his sacred club -- or his legendary temper, which could decimate the battlefield if he unleashed its full wrath.

= General =

New Electrician Avatar: Osiris Reborn
- The god of death and resurrection felt the flood of souls leaving the underworld when Calamity shattered the Vault of All Hells, and he immediately realized his weapons and armor were woefully insufficient to face the coming Third Corruption. His worshippers collected the needed designs and materials, and with a few brilliant mortal minds (smart enough to make a pact with Osiris in return for immortality, anyway) he created the Reborn arsenal, crackling with enough power to secure his place in the next era of Newerth.


== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

= General =

- Players can now properly leave their clan.
- Players in your Buddy List are no longer incorrectly placed in the Clan List.
- If the Minimap position is swapped to the right side, selecting a non-controllable hero will now make the Ward Slot appear on the left side of the target's inventory (instead of the right side).
* This change was made so the Ward Slot does not block the charge counter of the item in the top-right inventory slot.
- Fixed the description string for the Ascension Grab Bag Voucher in the HoN Store.
- Rage Kid Taunt's visual size has been increased by 30%.

= Heroes =

Aluna
- Stardust Aluna now properly plays her special voice clips when acquiring certain items in her inventory.

Amun-Ra

Drunken Master
- Shamrock Mistress Drunken Master now has an overhead bone.
* Effects such as Bound Eye & the silence state icon now appear properly above her model.

Gemini
- Together in Spirit now displays a channel bar when the skill is cast.
* Gameplay mechanics are unchanged, meaning that the skill is still not actually a channel & that you can still cancel it without putting it on cooldown.

Hellbringer
- Evil Presence's affector now spawns at the origin of the target unit on impact, rather than at the origin of your minion on impact.

Legionnaire
- Chip Legionnaire's 3D Portrait is now positioned correctly.

Myrmidon
- Apex Myrmidon now has visuals when Jade Spire is in your inventory.

Nitro
- Killing Mauser now teleports Nitro to Mauser's position if Mauser is killed first.
* This allows the killer to get the experience from Nitro when killing Mauser, even if Nitro is outside experience range.
* This also has the side effect of having Deadlift's Gravestone spawn at Mauser's location, and will make items that drop on death (e.g. Doom Bringer, Bound Eye) drop at Mauser's location in this scenario.

Rampage
- Stampede now properly gives Magic Immunity to Rampage when the state has 4 or more charges.
- Horned Strike's cooldown reduction (based on actual movement) now occurs continuously, rather than reducing the cooldown at 1000-unit intervals.

Salomon
- Avenging Leap now issues a non-forced attack command on the target you use it on after Salomon lands.
* This allows for better control of Flaming Cleave's directional usage right after using Avenging Leap.

Slither
- Red Scorpio Slither now has red-colored effects.
- Red Scorpio Slither's idle animation now plays properly.

Soulstealer
- Soul Burst now displays a channel bar when the skill is cast.
* Gameplay mechanics are unchanged, meaning that the skill is still not actually a channel & that you can still cancel it without putting it on cooldown.

Succubus
- Mesmerize's invulnerable state now has a dark pink visual effect.

Swiftblade
- Blade Frenzy's visual indicator now accurately represents the true radius of the skill.

Tarot
- Far Scry now properly grants assists to Tarot.

The Ascension has arrived! The benevolent alien entities known as Epicenters have followed Parallax and the Artificers across the galaxies, trying to stop their path of destruction. Newerth is the only planet with soldiers strong enough to offer resistance to the planet-ripping Fulcrums and their insidious dark matter, and the Epicenters have finally caught up to the Artificers. Now that they have, they will augment the warriors of Newerth with the power of light and creation to defeat Parallax and his nefarious kin once and for all.

= HoN Tour World Finals = 

New HoN Tour World Finals Magebane Avatar: Dark Mana Mage
- The Dark Mana Mages were created by the Corrupted Disciples to counter the Legionâ€™s magic casters, who use their vast and destructive spells to wipe out huge swathes of the daemonic ranks with a single spell. With brutal melee combat skills that allow them to pierce deep within enemy lines, the Dark Mana Mages are able to seek out the cowardly casters and drain them of their precious mana, rendering them helpless, useless to their comrades, and â€“ soon after â€“ food for the corrupted. 

= Soccer =

New Soccer Kane Avatar: Sudden Death Kane
- There are no players you'd rather have on your team than Sudden Death Kane when the game is on the line. With a legendary balance of offensive and defensive skills and the ability to instantly take any opposing player out of the game, Sudden Death Kane quickly switches from a master-class striker to a quality goon based on what his team needs to take home the silverware. He's always the first lad to go one-on-one against the goalie in a shootout, because the poor keeper will lose so much face in the confrontation. Literally.

New Soccer Lodestone Avatar: Goalie Lodestone
- Whether it's on the competitive pitch or in a high-pitched battle, Goalie Lodestone is a true field general, initiating scoring attacks and shutting down the opponent's top strikers. He is an all-star when it comes to making his teammates better, even if it means leading with his head and taking a few cleats to the face in order to get the win. But he isn't above making an injury look a bit more serious than it actually is, especially if it lures the opposition close enough for a full-on Soccerstorm. Now, who's ready for some REAL soccer drills?

New Soccer Pebbles Avatar: Stonewall Pebbles
- It's obviously a foul to throw one's opponents across the pitch, but so far Newerth's soccer officials haven't said anything about chucking teammates, and until they do Stonewall Pebbles is going to keep dropping his fellow defenders onto the opposing team's strikers and completely disrupt their offensive strategy. If the opponents happen to slip through that first line of defense, there's no need to panic â€“ Stonewall considers everything this side of midfield to be his property, and trespassers are not allowed. Should things become truly dire and the strikers actually catch site of his goal, Stonewall may lose his temper â€“ just a bit â€“ and clear the ball (and the entire opposing team, the refs, and a few hooligan fans) out of the stadium.

Soccer Announcer Pack
- Broadcast your goals across Newerth with the Soccer Announcer!

= The Great Rift =

New Great Rift Deadlift Avatar: Riftspawn Deadlift
- There is no solace in The Great Rift, not even in the soft slumber of death, for the Elder Riftspawn are able to manipulate the lifeless planes of existence within The Great Rift by unleashing DeadRift upon the ascended souls. This brutally efficient creature drags the shades back from divinity or damnation â€“ it cares not which â€“ to serve the further expansion of The Great Rift and the dominion of its Elders.

= General =

New Ellonia Avatar: Black Ice Ellonia
- Even the hardest steel from the City of Iron cannot penetrate the ice that covers the Frost Fields, leading many to believe nothing exists below the surface. But there are more powerful things than steel in Newerth, and the sorcery of the Black Ice Coven allows its members to move through the bone-cracking layers of ice as if it were a thin fog. The abhorrent rituals they perform in the labyrinth of tunnels and caverns have contaminated the once-pure ice with a darkness that can never be cleansed, and on the rare occasion they venture to the surface to collect the flesh and blood required for their fell ceremonies, all of Newerth feels the chill and shivers at the presence of the Black Ice.

+ Targeted abilities no longer cause the caster to stutter if you are just within the max cast distance from the target.

Engineer
- The Energy Field gadget is no longer selectable by pressing Tab.

- The set includes:
* Apex Myrmidon (Ultimate Avatar)
* Apex Blood Hunter
* Apex Bubbles
* Apex Predator
* Apex Thunderbringer
* Apex Tundra

New Ophelia's Apexes Bubbles Avatar: Apex Bubbles
- The Inner Sea Testudos have protected the precious water source against invasion for millennia, and when Ophelia asked them to join her in the fight against Man, their alpha warrior stepped forward. His unorthodox tactics and primal magic quickly moved him into her inner circle of Apexes, where he vows to remain until all of Opheliaâ€™s enemies are buried. No matter what â€“ or who â€“ they are.

New Ophelia's Apexes Predator Avatar: Apex Predator
- The Predators could barely be contained in the early days of the war against the Legion, often causing as many casualties among their own as they did the enemy. The Beast Horde was on the brink of turning on their vicious kin and driving them into extinction when the Apex Predator took control of the entire pack and instilled a seething restraint â€“ no one would call it discipline or control â€“ that turned the Predators into a truly terrible weapon for Ophelia. When Apex offered his pack the scent of their new enemy the Predators changed from hunting humans to daemons without missing a step. That said, they still enjoy making humans nervous. Itâ€™s instinct. 

New Ophelia's Apexes Tundra Avatar: Apex Tundra
- Apex Tundra was the alpha ape shaman of his domain before Maliken Grimm crossed the Iron Mountains into the Frost Fields, and when the war with man could no longer be avoided he carried his bone-shattering cold magic to the southern lands. His devotion to Ophelia only increased when the Second Corruption tore Newerth apart, and he will follow his queen into every corner of hell to bring peace back to her realms.


== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

- Sound playback and recording devices will now auto-detect & auto-refresh properly without requiring the user to exit the HoN Client.
- Fixed a crash when switching sound playback drivers.
- Fixed an incredibly rare exploit where players on the opposite team can unpause the game earlier than intended.
- Kongor now has a spawn effect.
- The shoutcaster's voice volume is now also controlled by the "Voice Chat Volume" setting in Options.

Forests of Caldavar
- The Wild Hunter camps now properly consists of 1 Wild Hunter and 1 Stealth Hunter (instead of 2 Wild Hunters) for the HoNiversary version of the map.
- Neutral camps now properly have their spawn-check zones visually indicated with grass on the HoNiversary version of the map.


= Heroes =

Arachna
- Spiderling model is now visible again.
- Spiderling's attack impact sounds now play properly again.

Balphagore
- Hell on Newerth's visuals now play at a faster speed to match the actual expansion speed of its affector.
- Hell on Newerth's affector shape changed from an expanding ring to an expanding circle.
* The affector's lifetime is a short 700ms, so an expanding circle is more appropriate than an expanding ring.

Draconis
- No longer gets shifted by Shellshock's Rolling Thunder's knockback if either Draconic Defense or Cataclysm are active.

Defiler
- Unholy Expulsion's radius tooltip value was updated to the correct value (850).

Drunken Master
- Impact interval for the consumption of Drink charges changed from 700/420/300/233ms to 525/350/262/210ms.
* This allows Drunken Master to fully consume his Drink charges from its max charge count, rather than leaving it at 1 charge after a full channel duration.

Parallax
- Ascension Parallax's Ionic Dash is no longer activatable if the hero has its Fulcrum bound to it & is on the Hellbourne team.

Shellshock
- Ol' Packsnail is no longer labelled as a Debut Edition avatar.

Tundra
- Piercing Shards now functions properly with Restoration Stone and in Duplicate Heroes mode.

The primary intention of introducing this game mode is to promote hero pick diversity and expand the viable number of metas, while simultaneously making each Matchmaking game a more unique experience.
- Once the teams enter the Hero Pick screen, Legion or Hellbourne are randomly chosen as the team with the first pick.
- The teams then pick in a 1-2-2-2-2-1 fashion.
* Example: If Legion receives the first pick, then the Legion team picks 1 hero. The Hellbourne team then picks 2 heroes, with the Legion team picking 2 more heroes after that. This hero pick sequence continues until the last player on Hellbourne picks their hero.
- Each picking phase lasts up to 20 seconds. If a pick occurs before the timer for that picking phase expires, the remaining time is consumed and the next picking phase occurs.
- Each team also receives 60 seconds of extra time. Time is subtracted from your extra time when the normal countdown has reached 0. If the extra time reaches 0, a random choice is made.
- Once the last player has picked a hero, both teams have 15 seconds to swap heroes with players from their respective teams before the game begins.

= HoN Codex: The Ascension =
 
The Ascension has arrived! The benevolent alien entities known as Epicenters have followed Parallax and the Artificers across the galaxies, trying to stop their path of destruction. Newerth is the only planet with soldiers strong enough to offer resistance to the planet-ripping Fulcrums and their insidious dark matter, and the Epicenters have finally caught up to the Artificers. Now that they have, they will augment the warriors of Newerth with the power of light and creation to defeat Parallax and his nefarious kin once and for all.

New Holiday Edition Magmus Avatar: Swagmus
- Sidestepping his way onto the battlefield, Magmus dons his glasses to show the entirety of Newerth that he is one bad-a** motherf*****.  Find out how you can earn the swaggiest avatar in the land by visiting the forums during this year's HoNiversary celebrations.
 
= Ophelia's Apex Horde =

+ Opheliaâ€™s Apexes are the inner circle of her Beast Horde, the alpha warriors from each species who bring their prides, packs, and herds to fight by her side. They honed their savage combat skills against the Legion of Man during the Human Harvest but now stand beside their former enemies to defeat the Hellbourne threat.

New Opheliaâ€™s Apexes Set Effect
+ If you own the entire Apex avatar set, each avatar gains a ring of human bones tied together with wild vines!
- The set includes:
* Apex Myrmidon (Ultimate Avatar)
* Apex Blood Hunter
* Apex Bubbles
* Apex Predator
* Apex Thunderbringer
* Apex Tundra
 
New Ultimate Myrmidon Avatar: Apex Myrmidon
- Hailing from The Boiling Sea â€“ named not for its temperature, but for the constant feeding frenzies that give it the appearance of a rolling boil â€“ the Myrmidons were thought to be mysterious creatures of the deep until their true daemonic nature was revealed. One of the sharkmen, however, knew a Hellbourne victory would lead to a true boiling of all water on Newerth, and water is life for the Myrmidons. He tried to rally his brethren to submit to Legion mercy and swear allegiance against the daemons, and he barely escaped with his life when his cohorts tried to tear him to pieces.
He knelt before Ophelia, seeking her forgiveness and acceptance. In return she forged him into the most powerful Myrmidon who has ever existed, the only warrior among the Legion who can seek and destroy the daemons of the deep where they live.
 
Ultimate Myrmidon Level Enhancements
- Level 1-5: Apex Myrmidon features sparse silver armor and a spear.
- Level 6-10: Apex Myrmidon features upgraded gold-trimmed armor and a trident. His Forced Evolution form features upgraded armor and a swordfish skull sword.
- Level 11-25: Apex Myrmidon features his ultimate armor and trident weapon. His Forced Evolution form features ultimate armor and an armored and spiked swordfish skull sword.
 
Ultimate Myrmidon Item Enhancements
- Boots: Sharks splash out of the ground and jump through the air to splash back into the ground.
- Grave Locket: The horned skull representation of Grave Locket appears on Apex Myrmidon's head with green glowing eyes.
- Tablet of Command: The runes from the Tablet of Command encircle and spin around Apex Myrmidon.
- Blood Chalice: Bloody water churns beneath Apex Myrmidon, replacing his normal water effects.
- Shrunken Head: Glowing blue skeletal fish circle around the weapon of Apex Myrmidon.
- Jade Spire: Pulses of electricity move along the shaft of Apex Myrmidon's weapon.
- Merrick's Bounty: Gold coins spill out from beneath Apex Myrmidon. (Not enabled during Forced Evolution.)
- Astrolabe: A 3D model representing Astrolabe appears on the base of Apex Myrmidon's weapon.
- Staff of the Master: The tip of Apex Myrmidon's blade glows and emits blue flame. Apex Myrmidon's bracers glow with magic energy and his eyes burn with blue fire.
 
New Avatar: Apex Blood Hunter
- Most of the Hunters betrayed their bestial brothers and sisters when the Scar opened, but the highest among them, Apex Blood Hunter, stayed true to his queen and fellow Apexes. Even though the rancid taste of daemon blood offers no sustenance, he vows to feast upon it until Newerth is rid of the Hellbourne menace.
 
New Avatar: Apex Thunderbringer
- In even the most chaotic, bloody battles between Man and Beast, the Apex Thunderbringer remained calm and focused on protecting his queen and wielding his devastating elemental magic against the warmongering Legion. The only time Ophelia witnessed this Apex lose his temper was when he learned the Hellbourne had corrupted even the pure energy of lightning, and his mission to remove their tainted hands from the ultimate force of nature has left a wide swath of dead daemons across Newerth.
 
= General =
 
New Solstice Avatar: Spring Break Solstice
- The winter months can be long, dark and cold, but Spring Break Solstice has been making the best of them in the backcountry of the Sang-La Mountains working on her freestyle dashes and slashes. Now that the first signs of spring are here, she's swapping her snowboard for a boogie board and hitting the Inner Sea for some sun, fun, and crazy night life!
 
New Plague Rider Avatar: Battle Armor Pegasus
- The Mt. Olympus-crafted armor and weapons may have been sufficient to defeat the terrible Chimera and battle the fierce Amazons, but the brave and loyal warriors Pegasus and Bellerophon have realized that when facing the insidious corruption of the Hellbourne, a more brutal kit is required. They now take the battlefield with heavier plate and mail and a spear sharpened by the shattered stones of a Sacrificial Shrine!

= Balance =

= Hero Rework =

Bramble

Spore Breath
- Damage reduced from 100/175/250/325 to 100/160/220/280.
- Upon use now applies the effect to every ally that has a Corrosive Pod on them.
- Allies deal half the damage and apply half the stun.
- Damage does not stack.

Rejuvenating Growth (Ensnaring Shrubbery, reworked completely)
* Range: Global
* Mana cost: 50
* Cooldown: 60 seconds
- After a 3-second channel, creates a growth at the target location.
- Allied heroes (including Bramble) can right-click the growth to start a channel that will heal 25/40/55/70 Health per second.
- Only 1 hero can use the growth at a time.
- Each growth can be used for a total of 20 seconds. It will change visually as it is being used up.
- Can have a max of 2 Growths up at a time.
- The growth provides 500 Clearvision, dies in 2 hits from enemies and gives 50 gold when killed.

Corrosive Pods (Combat Vigor, reworked completely)
* Range: Global
* Mana cost: 0
* Cooldown: 0.1 seonds
- Bramble will house 3 pods (charges) on him that he can give out to allies or keep on himself.
- If the ability is used on an ally, Bramble will give one of his pods to that ally for an unlimited duration.
* Pods are transferred through a projectile that moves at 600 speed.
- Pods will automatically attack enemy heroes within 550 range dealing 10/20/30/40 Physical Damage once every 2 seconds.
- Pods will take kill credit for enemy creeps within 350 range that you didn't last hit. When that happens the pods will individually go on a 45-second eating cooldown (this cooldown is for collecting last hits only, pods will still attack).
- Bramble gets 50 XP when a creep is eaten (finished off) by a pod on an allied hero.
* No bonus XP if the pod is on Bramble.
- If an ally with pods dies, pods will stay on that ally through death.
- When you target an ally and have 0 pods (charges) left or when you target yourself, you will take back the pod that is the furthest away.
* Example: You give 1 pod to Accursed who goes top and give 1 to Behemoth who goes to lane with you bottom. You then use the ability on yourself in-lane. The ability will take Accursed's pod and place it on you since Accursed is the furthest away.
* Example 2: You want to return all the pods to yourself. Just keep using the ability on yourself until you are back at max charges.
- The ability can be switched into return mode (via right-click on the ability icon or with a keybind) to take pods away from allies instead of giving them out. The effect in this mode is instant.

- While the extraterrestrial force of light and creation carried within the Epicenters is incredibly powerful, the dark matter wielded by Parallax is equally strong and will not be defeated without a fight. Both forces realize Parallax may be the key to saving or destroying Newerth, and the Epicenters will strive to carry him into the light and creation of the Ascension while the Fulcrum is determined to drag him deeper into the darkness of the Artificers. Which force will prevail: good or evil? The choice is yours, warriors of Newerth! If you play Parallax on the Legion side, he will be filled with the light and creative energy of the Ascension; play him on the Hellbourne side, and he will revel in the power of the Artificers and the dark matter they wish to spread across all of existence.

= Zodiac =

New Zodiac Slither Avatar: Red Scorpio Slither
- If you were deceived by the outwardly calm appearance of Scorpio, fear not -- her new poisonous, blood-red armor ensures all will instantly appreciate the strength and passion of her ambition. Underneath her detached air she is by far the most extreme and intense member of the Zodiac, and even though her focus is to return Newerth to a state of balance, her tendencies to embrace revenge and manipulation might extend the process a bit.

= General =

New Balphagore Avatar: Seasick Balphagore
There are many terrifying creatures in the Hollow Sea, each with its own myths and legends, and Seasick Balphagore has heard of none of them. As an avid fisherman whose appetite for seafood delights could never be satisfied, he ignored every warning and danger sign during a vicious storm and was pulled into the icy blackness never to return. But even the crushing depths could not contain his hunger, so he regurgitated the foul water and murk holding him down, plodded onto shore with a putrid crew of undead aquatic vertebrates in tow, and went in search of bigger fish to fry.

Version 3.8.7
-------------
5 April 2016


== Design ==

= New Hero =

New Legion Strength Hero: Shellshock: Guardian of the Sanctuary Stone
+ Shellshock is a mobile support hero who thrives on initiating small skirmishes with his teammates. He is able to bring allies with him into battle using Rolling Thunder and makes escaping difficult for his enemies.
+ The young, naive Shellshock is the lone Quantula Guardian of the Sanctuary Stone, a relic of immense power that creates a perfect equilibrium of life and death, darkness and light. Forced to flee his sheltered homeland of The Luminary in order to protect the Sanctuary Stone, Shellshock is constantly bewildered by the bizarre, violent actions of man, beast, and daemon. Even more astonishing, however, is the ongoing discovery of his own tremendous power.

Shellshock Abilities

Fireflies
- Shellshock never travels alone, and can exhume these bioluminescent stowaways from the Luminary to light his path.
- Target a location to spawn a line of fireflies that lasts for 8 seconds. Each firefly provides vision in a small area around itself.
- Enemy units hit by the initial blast are dealt 60/90/120/150 Magic Damage. Enemy heroes who touch fireflies will be sighted.
* Range: 1600
* Radius: 250
* Manacost: 40
* Cooldown: 11/10/9/8 seconds

Rolling Thunder
- Curling into his shell, Shellshock rolls directly toward his enemy, picking up allies on the way.
- Target an enemy unit to roll toward them. Shellshock can pick up 1/2/3/4 ally heroes and 4/6/8/10 small allied units on the way, including Fireflies.
- Upon collision with an enemy hero, applies a 1/1.25/1.5/1.75 second Stun and 80/120/160/200 Magic Damage in a small area. Deals an extra 30 Magic Damage for each ally hero and 10 Magic Damage for each small ally unit picked up.
* Range: 1200
* Impact Radius: 300
* Manacost: 120
* Cooldown: 16 seconds

Sanctuary Stone
- The sacred stone from the Luminary imbues Shellshock with both the protective and destructive forces of Newerth.
- Passively grants 2/3/4/5 Magic Armor to yourself and nearby allies, and applies -2/-3/-4/-5 Magic Armor to nearby enemies.
- On death, drops a Sanctuary Stone which can be picked up, granting the owner the current power of this ability for 30 seconds.
* Aura Radius: 600

Luminous Tether
- Shellshock's shell generates a viscous fluid that can contain his enemies in a single location. Should they stretch this fluid too far, it will snap, damaging them and any units around them.
- Activate to deal 120/180/240 Magic Damage to nearby enemy units and cover them in luminescent slime.Luminous Tether will slowly pull enemies back to their starting position.
- If an enemy pulls the tether too far, it will snap, dealing 120/180/240 Magic Damage to them and applying a tapering 80% Movement Speed Slow. Deals 60/90/120 Magic Damage to enemies by the affected target.
* Radius: 400
* Manacost: 100150/200
* Cooldown: 100/90/80 seconds

New Debut Edition Shellshock Avatar: Crochetshock
- This soft and snuggly snail was made for young Prince Jeraziah by the monks of the Shao Temple to console the homesick lad, and now the incredible power of the Sanctuary Stone has infused it with a life force brimming with love and compassion for her Prince and his Legion. She is more than happy to share a hug, but if anyone tries to harm her friends they will quickly find out her stuffed, enchanted shell can bring a sharp and thunderous punishment. 

New Shellshock Avatar:  Ol' Packsnail
- The Ol' Packsnail has been wandering Newerth for centuries, gathering damaged trinkets, seedlings, and critters to take back to his home in The Luminary so they can benefit from the power of the Sanctuary Stone. As he travels he spreads his salvaged collectibles across the map wherever they are needed to restore the ecosystem's natural balance, and though some may lament his seemingly lackadaisical pace, the Ol' Packsnail knows whenever he arrives, it's just in time.

= Songkran =

New Songkran Set Effect
- If you own Songkran Blitz, Songkran Disciple, Songkran Athena, Songkran Archer, and Songkran Hestia, each avatar will gain a festive pool of cleansing water and beautiful flowers beneath their feet!

New Songkran Holiday Edition Blitz Avatar: Songkran Blitz
- Songkran Blitz is ready to celebrate the new year by bringing the water festival to everyone in Newerth â€“ and we mean everyone! She's a blur of pure joy and merit-making as she dashes from town to town, cleansing away the bad luck and spreading blessings for a great year. Please join in the celebration and help her fling the pure waters and spirit of renewal across the map! Happy Songkran Newerth!

New Songkran Holiday Edition Corrupted Disciple Avatar: Songkran Disciple
- Songkran Disciple is out to show all of the other Disciples out there (particularly those obsessed with corruption and evil) that now is the perfect time to renew themselves with the cleansing waters of this joyous holiday! Join him in bringing in the purifying tide to wash away the sins and bad luck of the past with water balloons and soaking splashes! Even the most devoted Corrupted Disciples will have a good time!

New Songkran Holiday Edition Demented Shaman Avatar: Songkran Athena
- Even though Athena is a goddess, the constant application of wisdom, courage, and war strategy amidst all these dense mortals can be exhausting. It's time for a vacation! For centuries, she has heard about the joyous celebration of Songkran, and the idea of cleansing away the bad luck and burdens of the previous year sounds like exactly what she needs before diving back into her work of fighting for justice across Newerth. Everyone at the festival had better be prepared, because the goddess of war is on her way with a vast arsenal of water and the ability to summon an entire storm!

New Songkran Holiday Edition Forsaken Archer Avatar: Songkran Archer
- In a land that has been forsaken for far too long, Songkran Archer is thrilled and honored to zip around the map on her personal watercraft through the cleansing waters of the Songkran Festival, spreading celebration of the new year. She carries with her a sincere respect for every elder she encounters (especially those who are waaaay elder, like Athena and Hestia) and a high-powered squirtgun that is powerful enough to blast even the most stubborn bad luck back into last year.

New Songkran Holiday Edition Gravekeeper Avatar: Songkran Hestia
- While Hestia is traditionally the recipient of the first offerings during celebrations, when she joins the Songkran Festival she is honored to prepare food for the elders and pour water over their hands to show respect. She also helps people clean their houses, for an orderly home and hearth is an excellent way to enter the new year. When that is done and the festival moves into the streets, however, she is more than happy to douse her fellow celebrants with copious amounts of water to help them wash themselves of their sins and bad luck!

= Zodiac =

New Zodiac Night Hound Avatar: Ferocious Leo
- Hercules was rightfully wary when Leo the Nemean Lion descended from the heavens with a supposed desire to help the Legion, but after countless battles in which the ferocious beast decimated Hellbourne daemons and helped turn the tide against the forces of corruption, Hercules was more than convinced. He commissioned the elite City of Iron blacksmiths to forge a set of weapons and armor worthy of Leo's bravery and commitment, then presented the new kit himself, honoring his new comrade as a true hero and friend.

New Garena Star League Avatar: Ravenna
Gisele's younger sister Ravenna watched her older sibling get massive accolades and endless attention at Newerth's ultimate battle event, the Garena Star League, and she made a vow that she would become an even more powerful and impressive participant in the illustrious tournament. But she knew she wouldn't be satisfied to watch from the sidelines â€“ she would be on the battlefield! And while Gisele does indeed have a dazzling display of sparklers, beams, and stars, Ravenna prefers a much more electrifying approach, and she is prepared to overwhelm the competition with a shocking storm of GSL-inspired lightning and a case of sibling rivalry that would put Jeraziah and Ophelia to shame!

This disgusting Easter egg is the hunter, not the hunted, so scatter into the forest and dive beneath the bushes, little children, because the Easter feast is about to begin, and you are the main course!
 
New Easter Holiday Edition Pebbles Avatar: Easter Island Pebbles
- Centuries ago, when Death's Cradle was known by a much more benign name, the peaceful inhabitants of one of the many islands would carve a statue when one of their tribe passed into the next world. The deceased's epic and joyous life story would be meticulously inscribed and painted on the stone for all to appreciate. Well, the Hellflower poachers don't have any time for that nonsense. They found the massive stone statues along the coast of the overgrown island unsettling at first, but quickly forgot about them and began hacking through the undergrowth and churning the fertile soil in search of those lethal, elusive blossoms. Even the human remains they unearthed only slowed them long enough to toss the brittle bones aside, and in their haste they were oblivious when the statues began to move. The desecration was unacceptable to these honored dead, and the poachers were the first of many to get launched from the island straight into the next world for further punishment.

New Bombardier Avatar: Oderr the Fiery Viking
- Oderr isn't the mightiest Viking to ever walk the mortal plane, so he has to make up for any physical shortcomings with ingenuity and a generous application of his personal incendiary concoction of grain alcohol, pine resin, sulphur, and crude oil. Entire shield walls flee in terror and longships become instant funeral pyres when Oderr lobs his firebombs into their midst, and when the battlefield is just a smoldering testament to his warfare prowess, his flammable brew doubles as a tolerable victory beverage.

= The Paragons =
 
New Paragon Ultimate Magmus Avatar: Spectrum
+ The Paragons are a faction of ancient, elemental guardians from the isolated Isle of Argentia. They embody the wisdom, emotion, and power of the earth, and the flesh of each Paragon has been overtaken by veins of crystals that hold a strong connection to the planet. They have refused to enter the wars among Man, Beast, and Daemon for fear that if captured, their bodies could be used as conduits to feed death and corruption directly into the earth.
But with King Jeraziah driven to the brink of his faith and needing someone to counter the self-righteous destruction of the URSA Corps, he summons The Paragons, knowing that once they see the state of Newerth they will be compelled to join the fight against the Hellbourne as well.
The Spectrum Paragon is the pinnacle of the elemental guardians, possessing the ability to reduce any Paragon crystal into a molten state and absorb it, and its power, into his being. His demeanor also runs the gamut of his fellow Paragons; when he absorbs Tourmaline shards he becomes calm and tranquil, while Bloodstone and Carnelian will have his enemies stampeding each other to escape his wrath. The former may be oddly preferable, though, as the sight of an eerily serene Spectrum Paragon slaughtering the enemies of Newerth is profoundly unsettling.

New St. Patrick's Day Holiday Edition Drunken Master Avatar: Shamrock Mistress
- St. Patrick may have banished all snakes from Ireland, but the Shamrock Mistress is only interested in banishing all party-poopers from Newerth. Pouring and slinging her frothy green beers at a â€œone for you, one for meâ€ ratio, sheâ€™s prepared to drink any challengers under the table and smash any non-partying sourpusses under her double-fisted mugs.

New Aluna Avatar: Spirit Warrior
- Normally peaceful and kind, Dryad Aluna spends her time playing with the creatures of the forest, their days filled with joy and happiness. That was until the Hellbourne scourge began sweeping across the land and turning everything to ash, the agonized screams falling on remorseless ears. These daemons are going to find out what happens when you force a Dryad to fight, and it isnâ€™t going to be joyful or happy.
 
New Blacksmith Avatar: Dwarf Lord
- A grizzled veteran who cut his teeth in the War of the Single Banner against King Maliken Grimm and his High Knights, the Dwarf Lord earned legendary status when he faced Domitor the Breaker in single combat â€“ a sign of boundless bravery or complete insanity â€“ and repelled the High Knight's assault on Bolwark, the last dwarf stronghold. The fortress eventually fell, of course, and the dwarves were scattered into the Iron Mountain caverns, but the Dwarf Lord has continued to defend his land and people against all threats, dead or alive, and he longs for the day when he can again challenge Grimm and his High Knights to a final battle. 
 
New Hammerstorm Avatar: Adkarna Hammerguard
-  Adkarna's wide and grand Gates of the Five Clans have been closed and locked by rituals of the Sacred Order since the Second Corruption, forcing all traffic through the narrow, bent, and heavily-guarded entrance known among the citizens as Jeraziah's Faith. The elite Hammerguards of Adkarna were given the only tools capable of smashing the enchanted locks, vowing to do so only when the Hellbourne were defeated or on the verge of overrunning the Legion capitol; opening the gates would allow a mass exodus of the city's inhabitants, increasing the chance that some would survive to continue the human race. In these dire days, however, the king has need for every walking warrior, and the devout Hammerguards welcome the opportunity to show what their enchanted hammers can do to daemon skulls.
 
New Legionnaire Avatar: Argentus
-  The Sacred Order of Arasunia scoffed when Jeraziah sent the grizzled warrior Argentus to protect them. He was on rotation away from the front lines and the king wanted a low-risk assignment for this highly decorated soldier while he tested the latest work of war from Tork's forge. It was a suit of hardened, enchanted silver, resistant to corruption and a complete affront to the sensibilities of the Sacred Order. They patiently assured Argentus that they were perfectly safe in Arasunia, and even if threatened, their unwavering faith in Sol would protect them. Still, Argentus did his duty, and when the Sacred Order stood bewildered in the center of a ring of headless daemon corpses they discovered a new appreciation for the calm veteran, who wiped the blood from his new armor and went hunting for more enemies.
 
New Midas Avatar: Warrior King Midas
- While King Midas has been a vital warrior in the battle against the Hellbourne, his absence from his kingdom has allowed a cunning and subversive faction to fester. These so-called revolutionaries mask their lust for Midas's gold under the guise of collective ownership and distribution of wealth, but Midas knows greed when he sees it â€“ indeed, he practically invented it via alchemy and ambition â€“ and he knows they will start with distributing to their own coffers, and stop there. In order to preserve the thriving economy that sustains his city and people, Midas must adorn his Warrior King's armor and return to his home as a conqueror. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and severed are the heads that threaten his people.
 
New Moira Avatar: Arcanium Armor Moira
- Because of the unstable, arcane energy coursing through Moiraâ€™s body, any standard armor that comes in contact with her is immediately destroyed. The Blacksmiths have had to develop an entirely new form of steel imbued with the same arcane magic used to forge Harkonâ€™s Blade. They named this new alloy Arcanium, and the custom suit of armor they created for Moira will be its first test on the battlefield. As long as it doesnâ€™t explode and kill everyone around her, everything should be fine...

Version 3.8.4
-------------
23 February 2016
 
 
== Design ==
 
= The Paragon Grimm Hunt =
 
+ The Grimm Hunt has received an overhaul!
+ The Paragon Grimm Hunt is a testing ground for the Paragons and those who wish to fight for â€“ or against â€“ the survival of Newerth. Its purpose is to gauge the allies and enemies of the Paragons and uncover who is worthy, and who is lacking.
+ The landscape now teems with crystals that glow with Newerth's energy, and the respawn wells are shrines to the crystals that give the Paragons their elemental powers as well as a tribute to those Paragons who have given their lives in defense of Newerth. It is a sacred battleground where only the finest warriors dare set foot.

- A new Paragon-themed aesthetic
- Map alterations
- Three new constructs
- Two boss monsters that spawn for a team when they reach 5000 points
- Fully updated with the new item list from our latest balance patch
 
New Grimm Hunt Boss: Pulverizers
+ When a team has achieved their point goal in The Paragon Grimm Hunt, two Pulverizers spawn from that team's respective barracks and march towards the enemy's base along the top and bottom lanes.
- Pulverizers disarm towers on attack.
 
New Grimm's Hunt Construct: Baubles
+ Docile and cowardly, this construct has no form of attacks. Whenever dropping below certain health thresholds, this construct attempts to flee by quickly advancing to a random position.
- Cannot attack or damage enemies.
- Ability occurs at every 25% health loss.

New Grimm's Hunt Construct: Lobblestones
+ Aggressive but immobile, this construct attacks enemies by lobbing poisonous bombs in random areas. These bombs do not damage enemies on impact but they persist on the ground, dealing damage over time to enemies standing in the residue.
- Casts every 4 seconds.
- Poison persists for up to 16 seconds in a fixed area.

New Grimm's Hunt Construct: Torpidos
+ Immobile and clumsy but aggressive, this construct targets enemies and begins channeling. After completion, it rolls in that direction, passing through, damaging and stunning enemies. Afterwards, the construct is stunned for a brief period and receives additional damage.
- Channel lasts 2 seconds. 

Mechanical Change:
+ Construct kill speed variance across heroes has been normalized to a degree.
- Auto attacks against constructs now place a non-stacking debuff dealing 5% of their max health over 2 seconds.

New Gold Collection Rift Hunter Tarot Avatar
- With the ability to foretell the myriad futures lying before Newerth, Tarot has seen all too clearly what could happen if the portal to the Great Rift remains open even a sliver. But her powers of divination have no basis within the realm of perpetual darkness, and she has been forced to rely on the combat skills honed in her brief time battling the Hellbourne. Judging from the Rift trophies she has already collected, and her artistry in using them against the meager daemon foes of Newerth, she's been more than lucky against the Riftspawn.
 
New Rift Hunter Calamity Avatar
- The Great Rift represents a source of terror for most of Newerth, but for Calamity it is an arsenal. She knows that if she is going to rule the Third Corruption she must master control over all forms of beast and daemon â€“ she already knows how to master mankind, despite Jeraziah's reluctance to cooperate â€“ and when she willingly ventured into the writhing portal and returned with a host of horrifying, alien pets, Newerth shuddered in the presence of the Master of All Hells, whether from this realm or another.
 
New Rift Hunter Engineer Avatar
- The portal into the Great Rift has not been eliminated, but it has been contained. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the hideous creatures that slither and snap in that realm of perpetual darkness, and the bravest among Newerth's ranks must still cross over to prevent the Riftspawn from overwhelming the tenuous defenses. Tork the Engineer wasn't necessarily eager to volunteer â€“ no sane person would be â€“ but his endless curiosity and need to tinker soon had him adapting the monstrous flora and fauna into armor, weapons, and traps to combat the Riftspawn. When he discovered that the dark realm has creatures that explode on impact and squirming plants (at least, he thinks they're plants) that generate their own electricity, he gave brief consideration to setting up shop on the far side of the portal. Then he realized they don't sell cigars there, and vowed to reduce the entire landscape to dust.
 
New Rift Hunter Silhouette Avatar
- Many warriors of the Legion have been recruited into the campaign against the expansion of the Great Rift, and the assassins from the Hidden Villageâ€”experts at operating in the chaotic darkâ€”have excelled at stalking and killing the creatures clawing and slithering toward the gateway to Newerth. Rift Hunter Silhouette has taken to the towering canopy of alien flora above the deadly landscape, adorning herself with native camouflage and claiming some of the local critters to do a bit of the dirty work for her. Not all of it though; her custom Riftslayer blades want to have some fun too. 
 
New Rift Hunter Voodoo Jester Avatar
- Voodoo Jester knows he is not the source of the cursed magic he conjures, and so far he has not been able to locate the nexus â€“ if he had, he would have bundled it up and used it to decimate the Legion (and perhaps a few daemons he doesn't like). When he saw the monstrosities oozing out of the Great Rift, he reeled with the possibility that he may have found something much greater than the source of his own voodoo: the very seed of all evil. Yes, he will help Newerth by killing and appropriating any Riftspawn he encounters on the other side of the portal â€“ to do otherwise would lead to a quick and pointless death â€“ but if he finds what he is looking for, he will bring it back and show all of Newerth a nightmare far beyond anything it has yet seen.
 
= General =
 
New Oogie Avatar: Ogoh-ogoh
- Once a year the Ogoh-ogoh emerge from the mists of the Sang-La Mountains to cleanse Newerth of the spiritual pollutants created by the humans, beasts and daemons. While removing these toxins is a harmless process, the Ogoh-ogoh occasionally encounter a being who is particularly careless with the damage they do to the eternal energy and time of the planet, and in such cases a more direct purification is required. Blunt force trauma to the head usually works.

Draconis (Rework)
+ Draconis was a generic Agility carry hero that did not offer anything unique compared to other Agility heroes in the game since its inception. He has been reworked to a large extent: his main role has been changed to have global out-of-combat mobility to effectively split-push and counter-push, while also being incredibly powerful when defending ally buildings and on his own turf. His main attribute was also changed from Agility to Strength to make him feel more like a resilient and heavy-hitting dragon, rather than a frail dragon that outputs weaker attacks more frequently.
- Removed from Tournament Rules.
- Range decreased from 600 to 475.
- Faction changed from Legion to Hellbourne.
- Turn rate increased from 450 to 540 degrees per second.
- Base Attack Time increased from 1.7 to 2.

- Main Attribute changed from Agility to Strength.
- Agility decreased from 23 to 16.
- Agility growth decreased from 2.6 to 1.5.
- Strength decreased from 18 to 17.
- Strength growth increased from 1.9 to 2.4.
- Base Armor (without agility taken into consideration) increased from -1 to 0.

- Base Damage (without consideration of the main attribute) increased from 21-27 to 28-33.
* Total starting Damage changed from 44-50 to 48-53.
 
Dragonflame
- Mana cost increased from 90/100/110/120 to 95/105/115/125.
- Cooldown reduced from 12/11/10/9 seconds to 9 seconds at all levels.
- Magic Damage increased from 70/140/210/280 to 85/150/215/280.
- While Draconic Defense is active, Dragonflame pushes units by 200 units and has its range and radius increased by 2x.
 
Draconic Defense (Reworked)
* Range: Global
* Mana Cost: 60
* Cooldown: 120/100/80/60 seconds
- Target an ally building or your ally well to fly on top of it after a 2-second cast time.
* Cooldown is halved if you fly to your ally well.
- While Draconic Defense is active, Draconis gains 1200 Attack Range, 1000 Clearvision and -40/35/30/25% Attack Damage, and a further -30% Attack Damage penalty if attacking a building.
- Both Draconis and the building gain 100% Damage Reduction; after 3 seconds, the Damage Reduction is reduced by 8% per second, to a minimum of 40% Damage Reduction.
- Draconis cannot be moved from the building.
- Skill goes on a 3-second cooldown if damaged by a player-controlled unit while not on a building.
- Can be activated again to dismount to a targeted position up to 300 units away and move freely again, but the bonuses from Draconic Defense are lost.
 
Fiery Barrage (Reworked)
* Passive

New Ultimate Draconis Avatar: Knightslayer
- Knightslayer has long stood guard over the entrance to a network of caves in the Iron Mountains rumored to hold vast amounts of gold mined by the ancestors of the Third Clan of Man, the Builders. Many brave knights have tried to defeat this dragon, both to access the hidden riches and to add the fierce, scaled head to their trophy case. Killing the legendary Knightslayer would boost their status from famous to legendary.
Every knight has failed so far, and Knightslayer has adorned himself with pieces of their armor--shield, chest plate, banner, etc.--in an attempt to deter to any future challengers. This has had the opposite effect. Every man with a lance and a sword has sworn to slay this dragon to prove his bravery and skill, and while Knightslayer seeks no battle, he will not fail in his role of guardian and protector.

Knightslayer Level Enhancements

Levels 1 - 5: Juvenile form
Levels 6 - 10: Adolescent form

Levels 16+: Elder form

= The Paragons =
+ The Paragons are a faction of ancient, elemental guardians from the isolated Isle of Argentia. They embody the wisdom, emotion, and power of the earth, and the flesh of each Paragon has been overtaken by veins of crystals that hold a strong connection to the planet. They have refused to enter the wars among Man, Beast, and Daemon for fear that if captured, their bodies could be used as conduits to feed death and corruption directly into the earth.
But with King Jeraziah driven to the brink of his faith and needing someone to counter the self-righteous destruction of the URSA Corps, he summons The Paragons, knowing that once they see the state of Newerth they will be forced to join the fight against the Hellbourne as well.
 
New Paragon Doctor Repulsor Avatar: Garnet Doctor Repulsor
- The Paragons prefer friendship and harmony over conflict, and the Garnet Paragon is the first to extend an offer of goodwill to all he meets. If that offer is rebuffed, however, the offending party is deemed a hopeless blight upon the planet that must be removed as swiftly as possible. When his work is done, the world will be populated with loyal, sincere friends to the Paragons.

= Valentine's Day =

New Valentine's Day Holiday Edition Empath Avatar: Overly Attached Empath
- Overly Attached Empath knows your very essence. She feels the undeniable synergy between the two of you and knows youâ€™re destined to make all of Newerth jealous with your amazing chemistry and perfect relationship. If you donâ€™t feel the same, keep it to yourself. Romeo and Juliet is her favorite story because of the happy ending. 

New Valentine's Day Holiday Edition Nitro Avatar: Bosozoku Nitro
- There aren't any traffic lights or toll booths left in Newerth, but if there were, Bosozoku Nitro would speed through every one of them on their customized boomcycle. This reckless tandem craves the exhilarating freedom of the open road, which they are eager to create by blowing away everything that dares share a lane with them.

New War Effort Cycle 13 Andromeda Avatar: Eos
- Eos is descended from the bloodline of the Arclight Lords of Il Morg, and while she is able to harness the power of the northern borealis, she has no access to the wisdom lost when the Arclight Lords were exterminated in the savagery known as the Wars of Tooth and Nail. In order to survive the intense waves of energy coursing through her, she has worked with the master craftspeople from the City of Iron to create a suit of armor that not only keeps her alive, but allows her to focus her burgeoning power against those who would see all light blotted out from Newerth.

= Hell's Keep =

New Hell's Keep Corrupted Disciple Avatar: Inquisitor
- The dust and ash were still settling over Hellâ€™s Keep when the Inquisitors began their work. They commandeered the Luminous Reformatory, into which they herded and caged the fallen cityâ€™s aristocracy and clergy. These poor souls were subjected to agonizing torture and interrogation as the Inquisitors sought hidden gold to fund the Second Corruption and powerful relics that could harm the cause. The victims of Hopeâ€™s Keep have long since been burned and eaten, but the Inquisitors remain busy as high-value Legion captives are ferried to the baleful Luminous Reformatory to reveal all of their secrets.

= General =
 
New Fayde Avatar: Shadowkiller
- As King Jeraziah's faith wavers in the face of the old-world Paragon magic and successful anarchy of the URSA Corps, some of the Legion's finest warriors are bowing to a new god: Technology. When Legion raiding parties successfully breached the long-buried archives beneath the ruins of Hope's Keep, they discovered vast chronicles of scientific research from before Man's Fall from Light. The archives included dizzying formulae, pharmaceutical recipes, and detailed schematics for everything from wind-up toys to orbital kinetic weapons. Engineers pored over the salvaged documents and immediately began developing prototypes. Now, while most prayers to Sol, Aurealis, and Lunari go unanswered, when this new breed of warrior, known as the NeoLegion, invokes a response from their bleeding-edge weaponry and armor, they always get a response -- usually in the form of a dead enemy. Amen.
Shadowkiller was a member of the raiding party that breached the archives beneath the ruins of the Cathedral of Hope and, at that time, a devoted disciple of the Sacred Order of Arasunia. Her faith was rocked when she saw the destruction man had once wrought through science and technology, and when she first held the laser scythe created by the NeoLegion engineers, she felt, for the first time in her life, tangible power. Not something chanted and prayed about -- real power. If it had once been used to nearly destroy the human race, what could it do to the corruption spewing out of the Scar? As one of the NeoLegion, she is determined to answer that question.

New Succubus Avatar: High School Sweetheart
- It doesn't matter which class at the Adkarna Academy you're in with High School Sweetheart, there's always some serious chemistry going on. It's hard enough to pay attention to the Headmasters and Headmistresses when you're so mesmerized by her, then she passes you a note saying she's just as smitten with you!? Watch out though -- she can be a bad influence, skipping more days than not and hanging out with some unsavory types (we're looking at you, Devourer). Hopefully this doesn't end in heartache...

New Paragon Torturer Avatar: Bloodstone Torturer
- The Bloodstone has long been used by shamans and healers to control the flow of blood from wounds and therapeutic bleedings, but the true purpose and power of the stone resides in the Bloodstone Paragon, whose command of the crystals allows him to extract blood from those deemed a threat to Newerth, examine it to find the crux of their being, and drain the remaining blood from the body if necessary.

New Paragon Puppet Master Avatar: Topaz Puppet Master
- The wisdom of eons is encased within the topaz crystals growing upon this Paragon, who uses the acuity of the gems to discern the greatest fears and weaknesses of those responsible for the catastrophic damage upon Newerth. When the topaz manifests an enemy's mortal terror and uses it to destroy their psyche, the flesh is a simple afterthought.

New Chinese New Year Holiday Edition Monkey King Avatar: Unbound Monkey King
-  Monkey King earned freedom from his heavenly prison by accepting the tutelage of Ophelia, along with a golden crown that controlled his primal urges. With years of honorable service and semi-acceptable behavior behind the legendary warrior, Ophelia has released him from his restraints and unleashed his fully defiant, havoc-wreaking form upon Newerth. This might be something she regrets...

New Chinese New Year Holiday Edition Kinesis Avatar: Nian Guardian Kinesis
+ Every spring the ferocious Nian beast emerges from beneath the Sang-La Mountains to attack and terrorize the innocent, and while most villagers flee to the protection of the Shao Temple until the monster passes, the Nian Guardians stand ready to protect the people and send the terrifying beast away forever.
- When the time for battle arrives, Nian Guardian Kinesis dresses in her red warrior robes and surrounds herself with burning explosives to thwart the ferocious Nian. Knowing the beast likes to skulk behind trees before attacking unwary villagers, she mastered the ability to rip trees from the ground and hurl them at the Nian, driving it away for another year, but hopefully forever.
 
New Chinese New Year Holiday Edition Moon Queen Avatar: Nian Guardian Moon Queen
- Nian Guardian Moon Queen is a powerful ally in the battle against the terrible Nian. When the beast emerges from its underground lair, Nian Guardian Moon Queen is there with her flowing red robes and explosive dragon disc to frighten it away. If the monster is stubborn and determined to harm innocent villagers, however, she has the power to call upon the very heavens to strike the Nian down with explosive beams of dazzling red light.
 
New Chinese New Year Holiday Edition Pandamonium Avatar: Nian Guardian Pandamonium
- Every day of the year, Nian Guardian Pandamonium trains in his warrior's red for the one day when the Nian emerges from its underground lair to attack the innocent villagers of the Sang-La Mountains. When that day finally comes, he relishes the opportunity to send the fierce creature scurrying away in terror as he unleashes a flurry of explosive punches, kicks, and smashes that leave the Nian's face even uglier than before. Every year the battle is over too quickly for Nian Guardian Pandamonium, and the next morning he begins his training anew.

= The Paragons =

+ The Paragons are a faction of ancient, elemental guardians from the isolated Isle of Argentia. They embody the wisdom, emotion, and power of the earth, and the flesh of each Paragon has been overtaken by veins of crystals that hold a strong connection to the planet. They have refused to enter the wars among Man, Beast, and Daemon for fear that if captured, their bodies could be used as conduits to feed death and corruption directly into the earth.
But with King Jeraziah driven to the brink of his faith and needing someone to counter the self-righteous destruction of the URSA Corps, he summons The Paragons, knowing that once they see the state of Newerth they will be forced to join the fight against the Hellbourne as well.

Paragon Upgrades
+ Each Paragon avatar can be upgraded up to 5 times by acquiring upgrades.
+ Upgrades will become available in the Paragon Chest in Plinko after you own the respective Paragon Avatar.

New Paragon Behemoth Avatar: Carnelian Paragon Behemoth
- The embodiment of courage and physical power, Carnelian Paragon wields the molten and solid crystals of his namesake to bludgeon and blockade the corruption that seeks to infect all of Newerth. He may not be as subtle as the other Paragons, but in those times when a man, beast or daemon simply needs a good thumping for the betterment of all, Carnelian Paragon is an excellent ally to have around.

= URSA Corps =

New URSA Corps Kane Avatar: Uschi
- Uschi hails from the steep slopes and deep valleys above the City of Iron, where honor is more important than life and swords are considered family members. Uschi proved countless times she was the fiercest warrior among her siblings, but tradition dictated that her brothers would be the only children who could compete to carry their father's sword. When the Legion magistrates rode into their village and threw a celebration for the annual Harvest Festival â€“ a thinly veiled kidnapping of all females of childbearing age to ensure the worshipers of Sol did not die out â€“ Uschi could take no more. She stole her father's blade from above the hearth and fled to join the URSA Corps, the legendary elite unit of female warriors who have shirked all allegiance to kings, queens, causes, and customs, choosing instead to fight for justice and defense of the innocents. 

New URSA Corps Artillery Avatar: Ravus
- Ravus is a brilliant engineer with a penchant for long-range weaponry and massive explosions. Her love of utter destruction and disregard for petty politics has found her at odds with Jeraziah, his ilk and those damn holier-than-thou Paragon freaks, though the distrust and resentment between them is mutual. Like the rest of the URSA Corps her focus is on wiping the Hellbourne off the map for the sake of the innocent caught in the middle of this mess. Only then will the other enemies of justice get her full attention, and arsenal. 

= Steamworks =

New Steamworks Bubbles Avatar: Steam Mage Bubbles
- Thought to be just one of many failed attempts by Tork to merge the masterfully forged steel of the Iron City and the advanced intelligence found within Gundromeda, this creation sat forgotten and gathering dust. Beneath the shell, however, a small spark of sentience grew quietly over time until it ignited a raging fire inside, thus the Steam Mage was born and ready to fight fire with fire.

New Steamworks Pebbles Avatar: Siege Golem Pebbles
- Tork requested the warrior known only as â€˜Fluxâ€™ come to the City of Iron so he could discover how he is able to control gravity so freely. Flux, having a great respect for Tork, agreed and after months of tireless work they were able to harness a semblance of control over gravity in the form of grav-orbs, small spheres with the power to push or pull like Flux. Using these orbs to clean up wreckage from a recent battle, Tork had a stroke of genius. He quickly reprogrammed the orbs and before long created a towering giant made from the rubble of war, a Siege Golem with the sole purpose of raining chaos upon Hellbourne fortifications

New Steamworks Pharaoh Avatar: Steam Knight Pharaoh
- With every soldier able to walk and hold a weapon called to the front lines to fight the Hellbourne, the rear echelons quickly found themselves alone and vulnerable. Never known for idle hands, the City of Iron Engineers quickly set about solving this perilous situation by cobbling together what armor scraps and weapons they could find into steam-powered Knight sentries that not only stand ready to repel any daemons who venture close, but have also cut the drunken nuisance rate to zero.


= Hell's Keep =

New Hell's Keep Arachna Avatar: Black Widow
- When the first wave of daemons swarmed out of the Scar, most could not resist the quick, easy blood of the assembled Legion and Beast Horde armies. These naive creatures saw a quick victory and rapid domination over all of Newerth. The more sophisticated daemons, like the Black Widow of Hellâ€™s Keep, knew the Second Corruption would be an epic war unlike any before, and they prepared for it. The Black Widow turned away from the gruesome battle and entered the nearby city of Hopeâ€™s Keep, where she found a vast supply of huddling residents who would serve as excellent hosts for her spiderlings. Her webs and egg sacs took over the cavernous Cathedral of Hope, turning it into a rustling tomb of moaning, helpless victims who are devoured from the inside out as the spiderlings grow big and strong for the battlefield. 

= A.R.M.S. =

New A.R.M.S. Gauntlet Avatar: Invader Gauntlet
- The Invader Advanced Robotic Mobile Suits (or A.R.M.S.) have been hastily constructed in the Electrician's Laboratory in response to the Legion's discovery of the Savior battlesuits, and a select few Hellbourne combatants have been drafted into testing them against live fire or used as inspiration for autonomous versions of themselves.
After seeing the destruction Gauntlet brought to the battlefield there was no doubt that creating an augmented version of the hulking ogre would bring twice or even thrice the damage. With its giant hand capable of grappling and crushing a soldier in heavy armor into a bloody mass without so much as a hint of resistance, Electrician knew this was the pinnacle of his work. As he unleashed his creation into the fray, he reveled in the brief, terrified cries of the Legion soldiers before they were snuffed out with a wet crunch. 

= Hotshot Heroes =

New Hotshot Heroes Ward
- Show the world this is Hotshot territory with this shining beacon of heroism! 

= POGs =

New POGs Avatar: POG Pandamonium
- These high-definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- Polyphemus' Grapple projectile model size is no longer abnormally large.

- Decapitate (when boosted by Staff of the Master) will now refresh Legionnaire's other skill cooldowns properly if it is used to kill Nitro's Mauser.

- Conscription now properly cancels Homecoming Stone's channeling.

Nitro
- Mauser now properly plays his walk animation while hexed (e.g. Pollywog Priest's Morph).

Nymphora
- Beelzebub Nymphora no longer displays white textures for Mac or Linux operating systems.

Oogie
- Boogie Oogie's Conflagration sounds no longer become muted when a Courier notification occurs.

Pollywog Priest
- Classic Pollywog Priest now properly plays a cast sound for Morph.

Puppet Master
- Voodoo Puppet no longer deals DoT damage to the target if Voodoo Puppet takes non-DoT damage.
* This means that spells like Succubus' Mesmerize will no longer block non-DoT damage taken from Voodoo Puppet.

Rally
- Bogatyr Rally's and Savior Rally's Demoralizing Roar visuals now match the actual radius of the skill.

Sand Wraith
- Mirage's disarmed state icon is no longer visible on illusions when they cannot attack (1 second after the skill activation).

Skrap

* Silver Bullet's projectile trail is gold instead of blue.
** Credit to firemanash for his contributions!

Version 3.8.0
-------------
15 December 2015
 
== Design ==
 
= Hero Balance =

+ Added to Tournament Rules:
- Forsaken Archer
- Nitro
- Ravenor
- Skrap
- Vindicator
 
+ Removed from Tournament Rules:
- Artesia
- Electrician
- Tremble
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Arachna
+ Arachnaâ€™s Precision was simply dealing too much damage. These changes will bring the damage more in line, allowing Arachna to be less burst-centric.

Precision
- Minimum Bonus Attack Damage percentage dealt reduced from 10% to 5%.
- Maximum Bonus Attack Damage percentage dealt reduced from 40/60/80/100% to 20/40/60/80%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Artesia (Rework)
+ Artesia has had a problem with overlap since her inception. Her global ultimate and a playstyle that only promoted constantly pumping out damage onto a target made her similar to heroes like Bombardier or Thunderbringer. The following rework will allow Artesia to choose to be a solid damage dealer or a strong healer at a moment's notice, giving her more depth and more appeal in a wider variety of lineups.

Arcane Missile
- Cooldown rescaled from 5/4/3/2 seconds to 4/3.5/3/2.5 seconds.
- Damage rescaled from 100/140/180/220 to 115/135/155/175.
- Homing strength of missiles has been increased from 0.07 to 0.12.
- Explosion radius increased from 150 to 200.
- Mana cost rescaled from 90/95/100/105 to 80/90/100/110.
- This ability now has a second mode.
- While in Healing Mode, this ability targets allies instead of enemies, healing them for 30/40/50/60 Health. Cooldown and mana cost while in this mode are cut in half.
* More details on how to activate this mode below.

Dance of Death
- Reworked
- Activate to channel for up to 3/4/5/6 seconds.
- While channeling, you gain unit-walking and can move and use items and abilities without interrupting the channel. You are disarmed during the channel.
- While channeling, you gain a charge of Arcane Bolts every 0.4/0.35/0.3/0.25 seconds and allows Arcane Missile to travel through creeps.
- The channel stops if you get Stunned, Silenced, or use the ability again.
* 100/110/120/130 mana cost, 10 second cooldown. Cooldown starts only after the channel stops.

Arcane Bolts
- This ability is now available at the start. Releases no bolts until leveled up.
- Can now be activated to switch into Healing Mode. Can be swapped back and forth between its primary mode (Damage Mode) and Healing Mode.
- While in Healing Mode, Arcane Bolts will be fired at allies instead of enemies, healing them.
* This changes the effects of Arcane Missile as well.
- Increased the amount of bolts granted for each spell cast from 2 to 4.
- Damage reduced from 25/40/55/70 to 8/12/16/20, Heal is 5/7/9/11.
- Range increased from 700 to 800.
- Bolts release interval decreased from 0.8 seconds to 0.4 seconds.

Essence Projection
- After placement, the skill can now be activated again to move the Projection to a new location on an 8 second cooldown (25 mana cost). 
* Goes on a 5 second cooldown if the Projection takes damage.
- No longer global, range reduced to 800.
- Mana cost reduced from 200/300/400 to 150.
- Aura Regeneration is now separate. You now only get the Mana Regeneration (20/30/40) in Damage Mode or only Health Regeneration in Healing Mode.
- Aura radius increased from 600 to 900.
- Cooldown reduced from 90/75/60 seconds to 60 seconds.

Added Staff of the Master
- Increases cast range to 5000 (both for the initial cast and the subsequent movement).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Behemoth
+ Behemoth has always been a staple as a support, suicide or counter initiator. The damage on Shockwave has always been a bit over the top in term of numbers, and this is just a small way of tweaking a hero that has one amazing kit.

Shockwave:
- Damage from bonus shockwaves reduced from 35/45/55 to 25/35/45.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Berzerker
+ Something small to make Strength Sap slightly more appealing to assist his farm.

Strength Sap:
- Damage to creeps increased from 20/0.5s to 25/0.5s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Bombardier
+ This change is aimed at giving back Boom Dust its presence as a single target effect, while still keeping an area of effect focus.

Boom Dust
- Will now apply two charges to a single target if only one target is hit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Bubbles
+ A nice tweak to Bubbles to allow Kelp Field to improve and maintain its effectiveness into the late game.

Kelp Field
- Cooldown lowered from 115/100/85 to 100/90/80 seconds.

Added Staff of the Master:
- Damage and stun when breaking the Kelp Field becomes Superior Magic.
- Cooldown reduced from 100/90/80 to 60 seconds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Circe
+ A very simple tweak to an ability that was under-performing.

Entrapment
- Immobilize duration increased from 1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds to 2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Deadlift 
+ Deadlift is a monster pusher, but currently he is also over the top in terms of hero harassment and damage. We wanted to tone down some of the things he was too good at, while allowing Resurrection to shine as one of the unique abilities in HoN.

Death Grip
- Channel duration reduced from 4.6 to 4.5 seconds.
- Missile speed decreased from 700 to 600. As a result, its max travel distance was decreased from 3300 to 2800.

Onslaught
- Increased the target radius (creeps affected around the target) from 700 to 700/800/900/1000.
* This change makes it so that your creeps from The Dead Shall Rise will be within range most of the time. Otherwise, your own creeps on the edge of Onslaught's cast range would not be affected.
- Damage on creeps affected changed from "enemy creeps only deal 30% of damage" to "all units affected only deal 50% of damage against heroes."
- Attack Speed bonus reduced from 20/50/80/110 to 0/25/50/75.

Resurrection 
- Now has 2 charges. Gains 1 charge every 120 seconds.
- Now revives the target with 50/60/70% of Health and Mana (decreased from 50/75/100%).
- Heroes that die with the Death Protection state (the 30 second state which prevents them losing gold upon death) no longer leave a Gravestone.
- Cooldown reduced from 140 to 5 seconds.
- You can now target ally hero portraits in the top left.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Deadwood
+ Another realignment change after the last patch. His numbers are good and people are picking him in different lineups but the overall damage output was slightly off. This change will adjust his power level slightly, but still allows him to fulfill his staple ganker role effectively.
 
Willowmaker
- Reduced flat Physical Damage from 250/475/725 to 200/400/600

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Defiler
+ The new Staff of the Master effect has gone over very well and it is really allowing Defiler to shine in all brackets of play. However, the potential of the hero was too high in regards to both kill and push power. As more players figure out her new talents, we want to make sure it does not go overboard.

Unholy Expulsion
- Secondary activation (from Staff of the Master) cooldown increased from 6 seconds to 10 seconds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Electrician (Redesign)
+ Electrician has always lacked a few tools to excel into the mid game, and without his mid game, his late game was non-existent. With this redesign of Static Grip, we wanted Electrician to be a real threat to locking someone down. This hero fits a unique niche in our game as the â€œpurge heroâ€; with these changes, his baseline has improved much like what we did with Lord Salforis in the last patch.

- Intelligence growth increased from 1.3 to 1.5

Static Grip
- Electrician can now act freely while Static Grip is active.
- Static Grip is cancelled if Electrician is Stunned, Silenced, if the link state is purged from the target, or if the distance between Electrician and the target exceeds 700 units.
- Max duration decreased from 2.5/3.25/4/4.75 seconds to 2/2.6/3.2/3.8 seconds.
- Magic Damage adjusted from 20/40/65/80 per second to 20/40/60/80 per second.

Electric Shield
- Power of the shield changed from 0.5/0.6/0.8/1.33x to 0.75/0.95/1.15/1.35x of Mana spent.

Energy Absorption
- Mana drain increased from 3/6/9/12% to 8/10/12/14% of the target's mana pool.

Cleansing Shock
- Now chains to 0/1/2 additional nearby targets without the need of a Staff of the Master.
- Staff of the Master effect removed (for now)
- Cooldown changed from 12/8/4 seconds to 9 seconds at all levels.
- Mana cost increased from 25 to 25/35/45.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Glacius
+ You knew it, we knew it, Chilling Presence needed a small nerf.

Chilling Presence:
- Max mana granted reduced from 50/100/150/200 to 40/80/120/160.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Hellbringer
+ Hellbringer has remained on the top of the win charts for a while, and it was mainly due to the strength of Malphas. It was our firm belief that Malphas being strong and the centerpiece of Hellbringer was okay due to how easily you can counter Malphas with Nullfire Blade. Even with Nullfire Blade, Malphas was doing too much damage in most cases, so we have toned him down. We have also readjusted Hellbringer's stats to make him more level dependent until level 11.
- Base Intelligence lowered from 24 to 20.
- Intelligence gain increased from 2.9 to 3.3.
- Move Speed lowered from 295 to 290.
- Base Damage increased from 42-52 to 47-57.
 
Summon Malphas
- Total Magic Damage dealt by the Damage-over-Time (DoT) portion from the initial cast reduced from 60/120/180 to 50/100/150
 
Malphas:
- Immolate Magic Damage per second decreased from 25/50/75 to 20/40/60.
- Burning Sword bonus Attack Speed decreased from 25/50/75 to 20/40/60.
- Fire Bomb removed and replaced with Destruction. Passively grants Malphas 50/75/100% bonus Damage against structures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Madman
+ Madman is effective in spamming spells and auto-attacks, these changes will allow Gash to be used to full effect in both spells and attacks. We also buffed the Staff of the Master effect a bit to make it a more desirable pickup.

Gash
- Now increases both attack and spell damage dealt to targets by Madman.
- Is now applied before any non-DoT Damage.

Insanity (Staff of the Master-boosted Berserk)
- Non-ultimate spells are refreshed upon dying.
- Death delay duration increased from 5 seconds to 8 seconds.
- Killing a non-illusion enemy hero while death is delayed increases the death delay duration by 3 seconds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Midas
+ This hero is great and with a little love, we pushed him to the top and is now one of the premiere suicides in our game. Now is the time to tone him down a bit and keep him on top, but allow players more time to react and take him down when needed.

Elemental Warp:
- Cast action time increased from 400ms to 500ms.

Transmute:
- Bonus Attack Damage reduced from 40/80/120 to 30/70/110.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Monkey King
+ Monkey King is a source of large joys and large frustrations. In the past, we wanted to try to keep the hero enjoyable to play but reduce a lot of his frustrations to play against. We did successfully lower some of his frustrations, but he fell off a little in the process. These changes are aimed at giving him a little more mobility in the mid game and a small boost to his farm and kill potential.

Illusive Dash
- Now deals 15/20/25/30 damage in addition to your Attack Damage.

Flying Nimbus
- Bonus Movement Speed while not taking damage increased from 10/15/20% to 10/20/30%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Moon Queen
+ This is a followup buff from the previous aura change to make sure a classic hero like Moon Queen does not fall off the scene. Her ultimate can provide a lot to a team fight and even more to a 1v1 gank in the jungle. However, as players got better, they have adapted nicely to mitigating the damage of Moon Finale. An increase in the number of beams allows for more of a team fight presence and give Moon Queen an extra chance to snag a kill. The scaling on Multi-strike was unnecessary and this change will open up Moon Queen to another option in her skill build.

Multi-Strike
- Damage penalty per bounce lowered from 40/35/30/25 to 25% at all levels.

Moon Finale
- Number of beams increased from 4/7/10 to 5/8/11.
- Number of beams when boosted by Staff of the Master increased from 4/8/12 to 5/9/13.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Pestilence
+ While Pestilence is a strong initiator, he provides a team much of what other initiators do. Here is a quality-of-life change for Pestilence while we look at what we can do in further patches to separate him more from other initiators, and allow him to stand apart as a hero pick.

Flight
- Cooldown reduced from 45 seconds to 45/40/35/30 seconds.

Swarm
- Backswing reduced from 0.9 seconds to 0.3 seconds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pollywog Priest
+ Pollywog Priest stands on his own as a great 1v1 hero, initiator and solo mid hero. However, his solo mid presence has fallen off and we have not seen him much in competitive play. A small quality-of-life change to Electric jolt will allow him to be slightly less level dependent, and opens him up slightly more to be played in a non-solo role.

Electric Jolt
- Magic Damage increased from 75/150/225/300 to 105/170/235/300.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Prisoner 945
+ Prisoner 945 is the king of single target restrain, and with the option of more restrain coming into Newerth, we want to make sure Prisoner will always be the go-to hero for single target Restrain.

Shackled
- Duration increased from 3.5/4/4.5/5 to 3/5/7/9 seconds.
- Attacks it takes to kill lowered from 3 to 2.
- Damage per Second lowered from 20/24/28/32 to 20 to compensate for the longer duration.
* Total damage over the duration changed from 70/96/126/160 to 60/100/140/180.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Pyromancer
+ A cult classic and great all around hero for the veteran HoN player or someone just starting out. A small increase in his Dragonfire radius will allow for better setups.

Dragonfire
- Radius Increased from 200 to 225.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Skrap
+ Skrap is a newer addition to the game and we are still assessing his place in Newerth. The first thing we noticed about the hero was that the Morsel pickup just wasn't impactful enough. The hero revolves around this mechanic and it seemed like you were always shy of what you needed. The Scavenge changes will allow for more Morsels and less tediousness in gathering them. Vorax is strong and with more Morsels in the game, he will be even stronger. With the changes to towers in the last patch, we want to make sure that this hero (who is already winning a significant amount) does not become too dominant.

Scavenge
- Morsel consumption rate and healing rate decreased from 1 Morsel every 0.5 seconds to 1 Morsel every second.
- Special Morsels spawn chance increased from 5 to 10%.
- Charges granted by Special Morsels increased from 3 to 5.
- The healing for Vorax is increased from 15/30/45/60 Health to 30/60/90/120 Health per Morsel.
- The bonus damage for Vorax is increased from 1/1.5/2/2.5 to 2/3/4/5 per Morsel.
- Morsel pickup radius increased from 120 to 170.

Unleash Vorax
- Base Attack Damage reduced from 120/150/180 to 100/120/140.
- Voraxâ€™s base MS increased from 275 to 325.
- Vorax now gains + 5 Movement Speed every 5 minutes.
*This matches his Movement Speed with the lane creeps whenever they upgrade their Movement Speed every 5 minutes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Slither
+ Slither's role as a Magic Damage-over-Time (DoT) hero was always outshone by heroes that have more Magic Damage burst than he does. By increasing his pushing capabilities and extending the threat of his Magic DoT spells through buffs on his Toxin Ward, Slither's DoT spells will eat away at enemy heroes if team fights drag on for a longer period of time.

Toxin Ward
- Charge refresh timer decreased from 5 seconds to 3 seconds.
- Every time the ward deals damage, all of Slither's debuffs have their duration increased by 1 second on the attacked target.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The Dark Lady
+ A small nerf to her farm potential and her escape capabilities was made by increasing the cooldown on Charging Strikes. This will force the player to use Charging Strikes more sparingly, as she has more downtime if she uses it to close the gap between her & the target, or when escaping/farming.

Charging Strikes
- Cooldown increased from 15/13/11/9 seconds to 20/18/16/14 seconds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Tremble (Rework)
+ Tremble has seen many changes over the years. We have tried to refocus him in an attempt to make him competitive. We have tried making Terrormounds not so frustrating to play against, but still provide Tremble with a solid play-style and advantage. After some long discussions with the competitors, it is our firm belief that having a hero with a double-attack is just simply too difficult to balance with items like Brutalizer and Thunderclaw. This isn't to say we cannot have an ability like this in the game - but if we did, the double-attack would be the centerpiece of the hero and will most likely be on a ranged hero. This rework to Impalers is to bring back some old school lane dominance and emphasize his play-style of attacking down one target at a time.
 
Dark Swarm
- Physical Damage per second decreased from 20/30/40/50 to 10/20/30/40.

Terrormounds
- Targeting mechanic changed from target position to self position.

Impalers Reworked
- Gain 10 bonus Attack Damage and a 10% slow per stack of Impalers to the target when auto attacking an enemy unit for 2.5 seconds.
* Impalers can stack 1/2/3/4 times and grants 10% slow per stack (total 40%) and 10 Attack Damage (10/20/30/40).

Hive Mind
- Now has unitwalking at all times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Wildsoul
+ We want Wildsoul to be our top jungle farmer, but by being in that role we need to make sure his other abilities aren't making him a powerhouse in all areas. He has taken a hit to Frenzy and Swipe to compensate for the high amount of farm he is receiving.

- Frenzy max charges reduced from 20 to 15
- Swipe cooldown increased from 6 to 8 seconds
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
= Hero Movespeed Changes =
+ Movespeed adjustments were made for a large portion of the hero pool, with most of them being movespeed reductions. These adjustments were done to address the movespeed inflation throughout HoN's lifetime, and were done in conjunction with item movespeed adjustments to address this issue further.

Aluna
- Movespeed decreased from 300 to 295.
Blood Hunter

The Dark Lady
- Movespeed decreased from 305 to 300.

== Item Balance ==
 
+ HoN has had some problematic power inflation through items for quite some time. We noticed the ratio of power per gold you can buy has increased over the last few years and it's time to do something about it. The current meta is almost completely driven from this increased item power, forcing heroes into buying incredibly efficient items they feel are almost mandatory. Heroes are often defined by items instead of the heroes being defined from their uniqueness and abilities.
+ There are many recipe items that give a lot of damage/stats for no cost. We are lowering a lot of these to reinforce that finishing a recipe generally is more for the unique effect it brings and not for its stats.
+ After playing with these changes, you should notice that the impact of finishing a recipe is enhanced at the cost of the cheaper components being less efficient. This will push the game away from the super-powered item meta and let many more heroes feel powerful and have a meaningful impact on the game.
 
= New Items =
 
New Component: Alacrity Band
- 25 Attack Speed
- 1200g Cost
- Relics Shop
 
Alacrity Bands were conjured by The Divine Coterie as a means to quicken their tumbling, juggling, and stage combat in order to further impress their audiences. They didn't care if the crowd was made of peasants or nobles -- they just wanted to put on an amazing show. When a half-drunk and superstitious baron accused them of witchcraft for possessing such agility and ordered them burned at the stake, the performers found another purpose for the Alacrity Bands: defending oneself and attacking one's assailant with a stunning level of speed and zeal. It was a short matter of time before the accessories were carried into battle, and the mass graves began to fill faster than ever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Component: Branded Sabre
- 35 Damage
- 2000g Cost
- Weapons shop
 
The Branded Sabres were forged by the Mordant Paragons as a means to showcase the number of souls they had dispatched from the mortal coil. With each kill another tally is etched in the blade, a permanent testimony to the sabre's brutal efficacy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Component: Luminous Prism
- 16 Intelligence
- 1650g Cost
- Accessories Shop
 
The Paragons brought many enigmatic items with them from Argentia, and the delicate and scarce Luminous Prisms are essential to even possibly comprehending the others. The glowing crystal lenses allow the holder to see the world with a fresh, unnatural amount of awareness and perception, along with a knowledge of the untapped power within all things and how to access it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Component: Perpetual Cogwheel
- 150% Mana Regeneration
- 1325g Cost
- Legendary Shop
 
These ancient talismans were forged early in the age of Sol to combat the Magebanes and the powers bestowed upon them by their heretical gods. The ceaseless movement of the wheel served a dual purpose, generating the precious mystical energies drained by those miscreant, pagan sorcerers while providing a tangible symbol for the eternal power of the one true god.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Component: Voltstone
+ A new minor item that will be the basis for all current and future lightning-based items.
- 700g cost
- Every 6th attack deals 55 Magic Damage to your target and two additional nearby enemies.
- Lightning can only fire once every second.
- Not attacking for 5 seconds will remove a charge, counting as one attack.
- Legendary Shop 
 
Hand-sculpted and inscribed by the original Thunderbringers in their quest to harness the power of lightning, Voltstones are common enough to be extremely dangerous to everyone in Newerth. Although the exogenous bolts they channel are less potent than shamanic Chain Lightning, it still takes a firm hand to hold a crackling Voltstone while it launches raw electricity at multiple enemies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Recipe: Arclight Crown
+ This new lightning item is debuting as the premiere Attack Speed item, reigning over all others when it comes to attacking as fast as possible. The proc will only bounce to heroes, so you cannot farm with it. However, you can deal a lot of guaranteed damage to heroes during fights.
- Components: Voltstone (700g) + Warpcleft (1800g) + Warpcleft (1800g) + Recipe (1000g) = Arclight Crown (5300g)
- Passively grants 90 Attack Speed.
- Cast Chain Lightning every 5th attack that deals 225 Magic Damage and applies a mini-slow to the target attacked.
- Bounces to up to two enemy heroes within 600 radius. Will only bounce to heroes no matter what your main target was.
- Not attacking for 5 seconds will remove a charge, counting as one attack.
- Chain Lightning can only fire once every second.
- Passive: If you are attacked (auto-attack or spell) for over 100 damage before reduction, a charge is removed.
- Combative Shop
 
At the height of the Tooth and Nail savagery, when the Beasts fell upon Man with the goal of extinction, the Arclight Lords of Il Morg harnessed the power of the northern borealis as a final defense against the encroaching horde. Each Lord's crown served as a conduit, allowing the energy to build between them, yet this was still not enough to defeat the Thunderbringers. When the Arclight King was the last man standing, he shifted the sorcery of the crowns to bind his enemies with the shattering power of the borealis, but the shamans defeated him before he could strike. In the centuries since, the Thunderbringers have tried to keep the destructive crowns sequestered from mankind, but humans have a knack of finding the very things that will be their undoing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Recipe: Bloodborne Maul
+ We have wanted to create a strength carry-based item for a while, but never found an interesting way to do so -- until now. This item might seem underwhelming at first glance, but in testing we have seen many strength carries of old rise again with the power of the Bloodborne Maul.
- Components: Axe of the Malphai (3200g) + Bolstering Armband (450g) + Recipe (1350g) = Bloodborne Maul (5000g)
- Passively grants 45 Strength.
- Each attack removes 2% of your current Health when you hit someone.
- Passively adds one bonus True damage to your attacks for every 25 Health you are missing.
* Max of + 120 True damage (3000 Health lost).
- Combative Shop
 
The Bloodborne Maul was devised centuries ago by the Mordant Paragons, who used twisted sorcery and brilliant craftsmanship to seal a copious amount of Malphas blood in a hollow chamber within the head of the weapon. Their intent was to create a blade that carried the destructive power of the terrifying daemons, which it does, but they discovered an added bonus: the maul cannot be swung lightly. Even the softest swing shifts the blood within, generating an unnatural momentum that builds to a crushing impact that leaves both the target and bearer wounded and weeping.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Recipe: Jade Spire
+ This item is focused on the class of heroes who are hardcore mana-based casters such as Torturer, Oogie, and Ellonia. It builds up from the new reworked Nome's Wisdom and adds on a unique active effect that is related to Symbol of Rage, but this one is strictly for casters. A powerful item that breathes life to some of our more underplayed heroes.
- Components: Nome's Wisdom (2125g) + Acolyte's Staff (2600g) = Jade Spire (4725g)
- Passively grants 30 Intelligence, 3 Magic Armor, and 100% Mana Regeneration.
* Passive Magic Armor does not stack with other sources of Magic Armor.
- Superior Wisdom Aura (Passive - 900 Radius)
* + 2 Armor
* + 2.5 Magic Armor (This DOES stack with other sources of Magic Armor.)
* + 2 Mana Regeneration
* 45% of mana used converted to Health (If full life, grants a shield.)
- Jade Rift (Active)
* + 500% Mana Regeneration
* + 100% Magic Damage Lifesteal against heroes.
* 45 cooldown, 4 duration, 125 Manacost
- Supportive Shop 
 
Only the most accomplished masters of sorcery are fit to carry a Jade Spire, both because of the high status they indicate and the amount of raw power they are capable of channeling. Amateurs and dilettantes who foolishly try to heft a Spire awaken to find themselves in hospital -- if they wake at all. But in the hands of a wise and humble expert, these scaled-down versions of the original Jade Spire temple lost somewhere beneath the Rulian Marsh can perform miracles of protection and rejuvenation for the bearer, while drawing every ounce of life from those who stand against them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Recipe: Soultrap
+ Early game supports and roamers rejoice! You now have a way to heal yourself as long as you continue to participate in hero kills. The Strength buildup increases your survival, while the healing sustains your presence in lane or while roaming.
- Components: Crushing Claws (150g) + Crushing Claws (150g) + Recipe (700g) = Soultrap (1000g)
- + 8 Strength
- + 50% Mana Regeneration
- When an enemy hero dies within 1000 radius, gain a charge.
* Max of 2 charges.
* Starts with 1 charge.
- Soul's Release (Active)
* Target an ally to heal for 360 Health over 12 seconds.
* Costs 1 Charge.
* Dispels on damage taken.
* 20s cooldown, 800 cast range, 25 manacost.
- Protective Shop
 
The Soultrap was devised by Legion engineers to capture the spirits of dead soldiers before they could be harvested by the Hellbourne, and after making the ultimate sacrifice these collected souls were released to breathe new life into the gravely wounded. But Hellbourne spies lurk even in the sacrosanct workshops of the engineers, and soon the daemons had their own name for the Soultrap: Lunchbox.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Recipe: Spiked Bola
+ This Agility-based item adds a unique disarm effect to the game. We forsee many semi-carries picking this up to help boost their damage output while shutting down the enemy carry. Keep in mind when you use it that it does not go through Magic Immunity!
- Components: Alacrity Band (1200g) + Dancing Blade (3200g) + Recipe (200g) = Spiked Bola (4600g)
- Passively grants 30 Agility and 35 Attack Speed
- On use, target enemy unit takes 200 Magic damage and is disarmed for 3.5 seconds.
* 45s cooldown, 75 Manacost, 650 Range
* Does not go through Shrunken Head and debuff can be purged.
- Combative Shop 
 
The hunter-gatherer tribes of the Savannahs have lived for centuries by outsmarting the faster, stronger, and deadlier creatures that serve as both predator and prey, and one of their finest advancements is the Spiked Bola. It can be thrown quickly enough to intercept a sprinting gazelle and hits hard enough to stun an armored rhino (though the tribespeople strongly advise against this), but it was not created just for hunting and defense. Because of the constant warring between tribes, the bola's length is designed to wrap around a large human several times, pinning his arms long enough for warriors to close in and finish him off. In the hands of a skilled thrower, the Spiked Bola can bring whirling, agonizing death upon even the strongest combatant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
New Recipe: Spyglass
+ With the changes to Savage Mace, we wanted to make sure there was still a hard counter for evasion in the game. Spyglass does that job well, but comes at the cost of consuming an item slot that is not efficient late game. An additional use for Savage Mace is always being able to attack a building uphill, making base breaking easier.
- Components: Punchdagger (500g) + Recipe (1250g) = Spyglass (1750g)
- + 17 Damage
- Scoped! (Active)
* Grants you Truestrike for 16 seconds.
* While the Truestrike buff is active, all enemy buildings within 900 radius are sighted and revealed.
- 25s cooldown, 0 Manacost
- Initiation Shop
 
Scavenged from the crumbling loopholes of Watchtower, Spyglasses once used a potent blend of metallurgy and alchemy to detect attackers while they were still in column formation, marching toward a distant battle. Defenders then used the crystal-clear scopes to deliver devastating artillery on the massed enemy. In these days of sorcery and savagery, the same Spyglasses are used by warriors to survey opposing fortifications, track enemy movement, and on a good day assassinate dozens of the fools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

New Recipe: Ultor's Heavy Plate
+ This new armor item gives a lot of survivability with its ability to grant upwards of 95% Physical damage reduction while cleansing all debuffs off yourself. This is the single highest armor item in the game and finally the non-carries have a way to purge themselves of debuffs.
- Components: Helm of the Victim (950g) + Platemail (1400g) + Pickled Brain (950g) + Recipe (1200g) = Ultor's Heavy Plate (4500g)
- Passively grants 18 Armor.
- Gives 3 Health Regeneration and 250 Max Mana.
- Passively slows Attack Speed of all enemies within 900 units by 20%.
- Stalwart (Active)
* On use, dispels all debuffs and grants you + 100 Armor that decreases to 0 over 6 seconds.
* 50 Manacost, 45 second cooldown.
- Protective Shop 
 
Ultor was King Jeraziah's most experienced general in the war against his half-sister Ophelia and her Beast Horde, and he was first among the vanguard in that infamous clearing that ripped open into the Scar. Unhorsed and stunned by the onslaught of the Second Corruption, he was skinned alive and left for dead by Torturer. In the aftermath of the carnage, Jeraziah found the Martyrs finishing their last rites over the fading general. But Ultor was not done fighting. In agony, he struggled to one knee and bowed before his king, begging to live another day so he could avenge the soldiers lost to the Hellbourne. Jeraziah was moved to tears. The King himself designed a suit of armor, its materials harvested from the statues of the Five Disciples and forged by the Sacred Order, and when Ultor was sheathed in its plates he blessedly felt no pain. In the ensuing battle he fought like a man who could not be killed -- and indeed, he could not -- but when the squires peeled the armor off his raw flesh to cleanse his wounds the legendary general died instantly. The armor became a shrine to his courage and loyalty, and it is a rare warrior who is worthy of donning Ultor's Heavy Plate.
 
= Basic / Component Item Changes =
 
Ioyn Stone
+ We had some great ideals when we put Ioyn Stone into the game, but sadly they turned out to be just that -- ideals. The reality of the situation is that Ioyn Stone caused a lot more frustration than it did good play, and the result was a net negative when it was (rarely) used. We decided to remove it from the game for now.
- Removed from the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Portal Key
+ Portal Key has always been one of the most impactful items in the game when purchased, but it is currently being bought too quickly. We are slowing that down by a small amount while increasing the cooldown to promote it being used more as an initiation tool instead of an escape one. The Portal Key drop trick was also removed to prevent unintentional escape tricks with it.
- Cost increased from 2150 to 2250.
- Cooldown increased from 14 to 15 seconds.
- Now starts a 3s cooldown when picked up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 
+ Many of the changes below were made to normalize some of the variance in efficiency between different tiers of items. If an item does not have an explanation, this is why it was changed.
Acolyte's Staff
- Cost decreased from 2700 to 2600.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Beastheart
- Max Health decreased from 250 to 215.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Dancing Blade
- Cost increased from 3000 to 3200.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Glowstone
- Max Mana decreased from 150 to 120.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Homecoming Stone
- Cost decreased from 135 to 100.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Pickled Brain
- Max Mana decreased from 250 to 200.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Slayer
- Cost increased from 2200 to 2400.
- Damage increased from 40 to 45.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Steamstaff
- Damage decreased from 12 to 10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Sword of the High
- Damage increased from 60 to 64.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Warpcleft
- Price increased from 1500 to 1800.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
= Recipe Item Changes =
 
Alchemist's Bones
+ A small change to the item to tweak the buildup and use the new Attack Speed component. This is a small nerf to the buildup but opens up the opportunity to tweak it more in the future.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes an Alacrity Band (1200g).
- Recipe cost decreased from 900g to 650g; total cost from 1900g to 1850g.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Arcana
- Damage decreased from 17 to 12.
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 75% to 50%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Assassin's Shroud
- Recipe cost decreased from 1300g to 1200g (Total cost from 3300g to 3200g).
- Damage decreased from 40 to 30.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Astrolabe
+ Increasing the healing slightly, but in a way that doesn't buff the burst healing potential.
- Astrolabe cooldown debuff now grants 3 Health Regeneration.
* This means using Astrolabe heals for 200 and then heals for another 75 over 25 seconds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Barrier Idol
+ This restores the healing aura that it takes to build this item in the first place. A small buff, but one that makes sense.
- Now has a + 3 Health Regeneration aura with 900 range around the holder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Behemoth's Heart
- Recipe cost decreased from 1000 to 800.
- Max Health increased from 300 to 350.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Blood Chalice
- Mana Regeneration increased from 50% to 75%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Brutalizer
+ This item needed some work as it had internal synergy of Attack Speed, Attack Damage, and a percentage chance proc that also does damage. We are removing the agility to fix some of the internal synergy, while nerfing the item very slightly for agility heroes at the same time.
- Quickblade removed from the recipe, replaced with Branded Sabre.
- Recipe cost decreased from 1100g to 500g; total cost from 3100g to 3500g.
- Agility decreased from 10 to 0.
- Damage increased from 20 to 35.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Codex
+ These stats were leftover from when the item took different components to build. To compensate, we now scale the damage as the item is leveled up.
- 3 Strength removed.
- 3 Agility removed.
- Damage increased from 18 to 18/20/22/24/26 as you upgrade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Elder Parasite
+ This item, mathematically, is insane and the weakness of it was counteracted by itself. We removed the Beastheart to give the item an actual downside while buffing the active effect to be very impactful when used correctly. We are also removing the Activation Modifier, as wel feel that this item no longer needs the restriction with the removal of bonus Health.
- Beastheart removed from the recipe, replaced with Lifetube.
- Recipe cost increased from 400g to 625g; total cost unchanged.
- 250 Max Health removed.
- Now grants + 5 Health Regeneration.
- Active Lifesteal increased from 20% to 30%.
- No longer an Activation Modifier.
* This means it can be used at the same time as Shrunken Head and Void Talisman.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Genjuro
- Agility increased from 25 to 30.
- Damage decreased from 45 to 35.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Harkon's Blade
- Recipe cost increased from 500g to 600g; total cost unchanged.
- Damage decreased from 27 to 20.
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 150% to 125%.
- Attack Speed increased from 10 to 15.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Hellflower
- Damage decreased from 51 to 40.
- Attack Speed increased from 30 to 35.
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 225% to 200%.
- Manacost decreased from 150 to 100.
- Silence duration increased from 4.5 to 5 seconds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Helm of the Black Legion
- Max Health increased from 300 to 350.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Icon of the Goddess
- Max Mana decreased from 400 to 350.
- Health Regeneration from a nearby enemy hero dying reduced from 20 to 10
* 300 HP heal over 15 seconds reduced to 150 HP heal over 15 seconds.
* Mana Regeneration unchanged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Insanitarius
- Damage decreased from 12 to 10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Iron Shield
- Agility increased from 6 to 8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Mock of Brilliance
+ A tweak to the item so it is useful in a wider array of situations and deals more damage to those who are not Magic Immune.
- Attack Damage increased from 60 to 65.
- Aura Damage type changed from Magic to True.
* Target type is still Magic so it will not deal damage to Magic Immune units, but when it does deal damage to a unit, that damage is no longer reduced by Magic Armor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Nome's Wisdom
+ This item had no focus before, being a mix of all different stats. It has been reworked to be related to its partner: Abyssal Skull. It is now a great Magic Armor aura item that can be used to help a team that is under assault by a heavy magic damage-focused lineup.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes Mystic Vestments (500g) + Ring of the Teacher (500g) + Manatube (875g).
- Recipe cost increased from 200g to 250g; total cost from 2240g to 2125g.
- All passive bonuses (4 Strength/Agility/Intelligence, 6 Damage) removed.
- Now passively grants 3 Magic Armor and 100% Mana Regeneration.
* Magic Armor does not stack with other sources of Magic Armor.
- Aura now grants + 2 Magic Armor, + 2 Armor, + 0.75 Mana Regeneration and heals the unit for 30% of the Mana Cost of a spell the unit casts (shields them if their Health is full)
* Aura Magic Armor DOES stack with other sources of Magic Armor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nullfire Blade
+ This change makes it so that you no longer need to go through a weak version of Nullfire to actually get the good item you want. The item is now agility focused and still priced at the level 1 tier, as we didn't want to throw off the timings in-game.
- No longer upgrades.
- Apprentice Robe removed from the recipe, replaced with Fleetfeet.
- Recipe cost is still 700g; total cost unchanged.
- 6 Intelligence removed.
- Agility increased from 22 to 30.
- Burn amount increased from 20 to 24 per attack.
- Burn damage decreased from 100% to 60% of mana burned.
- Nullfire Blade's active now deals 1000 damage to summoned units instead of instantly killing them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Null Stone
+ Null Stone is triggered by many items and abilities, leaving it in a strange position where it is "easily" countered since it only goes off once a fight. We went through a lot of different iterations to try to find a balance where Null Stone was both impactful but not overwhelming in a fight. We found the root of the problem being how long it took to refresh once Null Stone fired from a low cooldown ability, thus the refresh time of the spell block effect was lowered from 20 seconds to 16 seconds. We also reworked the components to remove stats from the item and replaced it with equivalent health and mana, keeping it as an equal defensive item for stats and a better one for blocking single target spells.
- Components Reworked.
* Now a Glowstone (1200g) + Sustainer (1750g).
- Recipe cost increased from 300g to 1200g; total cost is unchanged.
- Passively grants 200 Max Health, 200 Max Mana, 10 Damage, 6 Health Regeneration, 150% Mana Regeneration.
* 10 Strength, 10 Agility, and 10 Intelligence has been removed.
- When not in cooldown, negates a single targeted spell.
- Cooldown decreased from 20s to 16s.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Puzzlebox
+ We did not find that much of a problem with Puzzlebox other than being able to build it too fast, but we mainly wanted to tweak some of the recipe buildups in the game to separate them from each other to prevent easy masking of builds. An example is Neophyte's Book building into 6-8 items. This makes hiding builds too easy, and we want to make sure that you have ample information to respond to item builds of your enemies.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes Luminous Prism (1650g) + Bolstering Armband (450g).
- Recipe cost decreased from 1250g to 1025g; total cost from 2700/3950/5200g to 3125/4150/5175g.
- Intelligence from 15/20/25 to 18/22/26.
- Strength from 9/12/15 to 11/13/15.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Refreshing Ornament
- Health Regeneration Aura increased from 2 to 3.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Restoration Stone
+ This item got a lot of free damage out of nowhere, but the Intelligence and Attack Speed items it took to build got no bonus. This has been corrected.
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 200% to 150%.
- Damage decreased from 41 to 20.
- Intelligence increased from 6 to 10.
- Attack Speed increased from 10 to 15.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Ring of Sorcery
- Max Mana decreased from 300 to 250.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Runed Cleaver
+ A minor buff to the item to give melee heroes an easier time attacking spread-out neutrals.
- Splash range increased from 225 to 275.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Sheepstick
+ One of the most powerful effects in the game has always been the ability to disable someone in the way that Sheepstick does. We felt this effect was too good to be linked to a huge amount of stats. We removed the bonus stats and instead re-focused the item on intelligence and the active sheep effect.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes Acolyte's Staff (2600g) + Luminous Prism (1650g) + Perpetual Cogwheel (1325g).
- Recipe cost removed and the item now auto-assembles (Total cost from 5675g to 5575g).
- 10 Strength and 10 Agility removed.
- Intelligence increased from 35 to 50.
- Transfigured effect duration increased from 3s to 3.5s.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Shieldbreaker
+ This is mainly a buff to the third level of the item, giving it a secondary use as a fantastic pushing item.
- Damage decreased from 40/54/68 to 40/50/60.
- Armor Reduction increased from 3/5/7 to 4/6/8.
- Level 3 of the item now applies a stacking -1 Armor debuff to buildings and gadgets you attack.
* Max of 8 stacks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Spell Sunder
+ Spell Sunder has always been in a very strange place as it was a relatively cheap item that gave an enormous impact in the late game. It doesn't do much if picked up early on, since heroes do not have much life yet. This was always strange and we have changed a few things to keep the focus of the item the same, but increased the price and effect, pushing it more towards that mid- or late-game point.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes Glowstone (1200g) + Perpetual Cogwheel (1325g).
- Now has a 300g recipe (Total cost from 2365g to 2825g).
- Max Mana decreased from 250 to 200.
- Now grants + 200 Max Health.
- No longer gives 4 Strength, 4 Agility, or 4 Intelligence.
- Mana Regeneration from 100% to 200%.
- Debuff duration increased from 3s to 3.5s.
* This is a 17% DoT damage increase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 
Spellshards
- Magic Armor pierce increased from 50% to 60%.
- Damage decreased from 17 to 14.
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 125% to 100%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Stormspirit
+ Stormspirit was changed heavily in the past and its usage has dropped off severely due to that. We wanted to re-introduce this item as a meaningful choice for support heroes during the midgame. To that end, you can now cast it at a much further distance, but using it to save an ally now imposes a heavy penalty on them when they land.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes Luminous Prism (1650g) + Manatube (875g) + Scarab (325g).
- Recipe cost removed and the item now auto-assembles (Total cost from 3000g to 2850g).
- Range increased from 450 to 650.
- Movement Speed decreased from 30 to 25.
- Still applies "Cycloned" to the target for 2 seconds.
- Now applies "Windswept" to the target for 1 second after "Cycloned" ends.
- Windswept: Restrained and Perplexed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Sustainer
- Damage decreased from 10 to 4.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

 
Symbol of Rage
- Now gives + 3 Health Regeneration.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Tablet of Command
+ This item has always been the go-to choice for any and all supports in the game. With Stormspirit becoming a viable option again, we wanted to make sure Tablet didn't overshadow it. We removed the stats off the item and replace them with armor. This means if you buy the new Tablet, Physical Damage mitigation is about the same, while Magic Damage will be slightly more effective against you.
- Major Totem component replaced with Guardian Ring.
- Recipe cost increased from 500 to 825; total cost from 2040g to 2000g.
- Cooldown decreased from 20s to 18s.
- 4 Strength and 4 Agility removed.
- Intelligence decreased from 14 to 12.
- Now grants + 2 Armor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Void Talisman
- Strength, Agility, and Intelligence decreased by 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Whispering Helm
- Now gives + 3 Health Regeneration.
- Damage decreased from 20 to 10.
- Lifesteal increased from 15% to 20%.
- Now gives dominated creeps a permanent 50 Movespeed and 1 Mana Regeneration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
= Armor Item Changes =
 
Daemonic Breastplate
+ This item has been arguably the best armor item in the game and has always been too efficient and powerful. We are addressing this by inheriting the switch mechanic from Sol's Bulwark, giving you a choice between a powerful offensive or defensive tool. Between this item and the new armor item (Ultor's Heavy Plate), we want it to be clear that Daemonic is the team armor item while Ultor's Heavy Plate is the personal armor item.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes a Sol's Bulwark (1650g) + Warpcleft (1800g) + Platemail (1400g).
- Recipe cost decreased from 1500g to 900g; total cost from 5550g to 5825g.
- Passive Armor from 10 to 6.
- Passive Attack Speed from 40 to 30.
- Aura Attack Speed increased from 15 to 20.
- Aura Armor reworked. Now, on use, swaps between Ally mode and Enemy mode.
* Ally Mode: + 7 Armor/20 Attack Speed for allies. -3 Armor for enemies.
* Enemy Mode: + 3 Armor/20 Attack Speed for allies. -7 Armor for enemies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Frostfield Plate
+ We mourn the loss of a classic item that has been in the game since its inception. We had to come to the harsh reality that the niche which Frostfield Plate filled was so narrow that it realistically and statistically did not exist. The purchase rate was abysmally low and kept a very unique and cool effect locked behind the steep purchase price. We opted to remove the item while moving the effect to Frostwolf Skull. See that item for details!
- Removed from the game.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Sol's Bulwark
+ This item has always been very efficient for not only yourself, but for your team. Lowering the power level of Sol's Bulwark not only makes upgrading it into Daemonic Breastplate that much more impactful, but also makes it slightly easier to build as well.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes a Ringmail (550g) + Guardian Ring (175g).
- Recipe Cost increased from 900g to 1000g; total cost from 2000g to 1725g.
- Passive Armor lowered from 6 to 4.
- Aura Armor lowered from 4 to 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
= Brand Item Changes =
 
Dawnbringer
+ Dawnbringer has always been a complicated item to balance. We don't want to overshadow the "big" items the brands build into, but we want it to be a meaningful choice as well. To accomplish this we have decided to make Dawnbringer the better passive stat item while the brand-based items have the powerful active effects. Players can now choose between the passive nature of Dawnbringer or the powerful fight-changing effects of Frostwolf Skull, Grimoire of Power, and Geometer's Bane.
- Searing DoT removed.
- Damage increased from 12 to 15.
- Movespeed slow per charge increased from 6% to 8%.
- Movespeed slow max charges increased from 4 to 5.
- Passive: when casting any spell, 40% of its Mana Cost is dealt as bonus Damage on your next attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Frostwolf Skull
+ Frostwolf Skull has always been an outlier in the brand tree of items. It was much more expensive, gave extraordinary stat bonuses, but had no active effect. We wanted to equalize this item with its partner end-brand items (Geometer's Bane and Grimoire of Power). These changes do that by lowering its power level from passive bonuses significantly, but also lower the price by a significant amount. On top of that, the item now has a familiar active effect that slows and deals damage to everyone around you on use.
- Glowstone removed from recipe.
- Recipe cost increased 300g to 800g; total cost from 5800 to 5100g.
- Strength decreased from 30 to 26.
- Agility decreased from 20 to 10.
- Intelligence decreased from 20 to 10.
- Max Health (200) removed.
- Max Mana (150) removed.
- Melee: Attack Speed Debuff changed from -30% to -30.
- Melee: Movespeed Slow increased from 30% to 35%.
- Ranged: Attack Speed Debuff changed from -20% to -20.
- New Activation: On use, releases a ring of ice that deals 100 Magic Damage to enemies within 750 radius and applies the slow (either Ranged or Melee depending on who used the item) for 4 seconds.
* Does not grant Clearvision on use like Frostfield Plate used to.
* 30 second cooldown, 100 Mana Cost
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Grimoire of Power
+ The passive damage increase has been one of the pain points in the game since it was introduced. This new version still appeals to the same heroes that would want it before but the damage increase is much more controlled. The short duration buff also rewards great timing, creating many new highs during gameplay.
- Searing DoT removed.
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 4 to 3.
- Passive 15% Damage increase removed.
- Passive: when casting any spell, 35% of its Mana Cost is dealt as bonus Damage on your next attack.
- New Activation: On use, increases all of your spell damage done by 20% for 6 seconds.
* 60 second cooldown, 150 Mana Cost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Geometer's Bane
+ This is a change for the competitive players that will make them realistically dodge more spells with the Invulnerability, but still require a high level of skill and quick reaction times.
- Invulnerability window increased from 0.1 to 0.2 seconds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Lightbrand, Frozen Light, Searing Light, Dawnbringer, Grimoire of Power
+ These items have had a farming tool on them since their inception, but it is not an effect that belongs on this type of item. To correct this mistake, we re-designed the effect to be based around the concept of giving Lightbrand items a better use for heroes who cast a lot of spells. It still has the great Mana Regeneration, so it is still effective for the strength heroes while enhancing the caster-based carries.
- Searing DoT removed.
- When you cast a spell the item gets charged.
* When charged, your next auto-attack deals a percentage of your previous spell's mana cost as bonus damage.
- Lightbrand: 25% of Mana Cost as bonus Damage.
- Frozen Light & Searing Light: 30% of Mana Cost as bonus Damage.
- Grimoire: 35% of Mana Cost as bonus Damage.
- Dawnbringer: 40% of Mana Cost as bonus Damage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
= Evasion / True Strike Item Changes =
 
Savage Mace
+ Right now, any interaction with evasion is skewed by Savage Mace. The item is so good, so efficient, and so powerful as a hard counter that it is arguably the best damage item in the game. We want to change this interaction to help Wingbow become a realistic pickup again, and also to implement more evasion-based mechanics in the future. To accomplish this, we simply turned off the passive Truestrike that Savage Mace provides. To activate the Truestrike, you now have to miss an attack first. Once you do, the next few attacks cannot miss. This leaves Savage Mace as a valid choice against Wingbow, but it is no longer a hard counter that completely shuts down the item.
- Components reworked.
* Now takes a Slayer (2400g) + Branded Sabre (2000g).
- 1100g recipe cost added; total cost from 5400g to 5500g.
- Damage decreased from 88 to 80.
- Passive Truestrike removed.
- When you miss an attack, as long as the item is not on cooldown, your next 3 attacks cannot miss.
* 6.5 second cooldown.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Wingbow
+ These are small number adjustments to the balance and changes to the bonus for melee heroes. The old bonus to melee heroes was very strange and did not have good feedback or impact on the game. Now we can give a great bonus that is something every melee hero will want: Unitwalking and speed.
- Evasion increased from 30% to 33%.
- Damage decreased from 32 to 30.
- Melee heroes no longer reflect damage on evaded attacks; instead, they now gain 10 Movement Speed and permanent Unitwalking.
* Item can be toggled to disable Unitwalking at will for no cost.
* Ranged bonus is unchanged.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
= Lightning Item Changes =
 
Charged Hammer
+ We wanted to rework several aspects of this item, but sadly when we had it in testing we ran into multiple problems that were unsolvable while still keeping the item the same at its core. We decided the better route was to remove it and introduce a different lightning item we could create from the ground up.
- Removed from the game.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Thunderclaw
+ This item was incredibly efficient for what it costs. It also filled a hard farming role, but in a way that we have found unhealthy for the game due to its pure damage output outside of farming. This rework keeps it as a farming tool that is comparable to Runed Cleaver, but for ranged heroes. It is no longer an item that will directly help you carry, but it will help your farm significantly to get you to those carry items!
- Components reworked.
* Now takes a Voltstone (700g) + Alacrity Band (1200g) + Warhammer (1600g).
- Recipe cost removed, now auto assembles; total cost from 2400g to 3500g.
- Attack Speed decreased from 40 to 25.
- Now grants + 25 Damage.
- Every 3rd attack deals 100 Magic Damage in a 275 AOE centered on the target.
- Not attacking for 5 seconds will remove a charge, counting as one attack.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
= Movespeed Item Changes =
 
+ These changes were made to lower the amount of movespeed injected into the game. There are many items and heroes that give movespeed, so we will be lowering that across the board. We want to slow down the ability to reach 450+ movespeed in every game with every hero.
 
Assassin's Shroud
- Movespeed bonus while stealthed decreased from + 20% to + 15%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Dawnbringer
- Movespeed multiplier decreased from 16% to 10%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Energizer
- Movespeed bonus from activation re-scaled from 75 to tapering 75->0 over its 6 second duration.
- Heroes and non-player controlled units that are affected by the activation no longer gain Unitwalking.
* Non-hero player controlled units still get Unitwalking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Firebrand
- Movespeed multiplier decreased from 10% to 6%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
Genjuro
- Movespeed bonus while stealthed decreased from + 25% to + 20%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Ghost Marchers
- Movespeed bonus decreased when active from 12% to 8%.
* Item still gives 70 Movespeed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Geometer's Bane
- Movespeed bonus from 10% to 8%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Marchers
- Movespeed decreased from 50 to 45.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Plated Greaves
- Movespeed decreased from 70 to 65.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Post Haste
- Recipe cost of Post Haste decreased from 1600g to 1550g.
- Movespeed charges falloff range increased from 900 to 1000.
- All charges removed at 775 range, increased from 600.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Searing Light & Frostburn
- Movespeed multiplier decreased from 14% to 8%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 
Steamboots
- Attack Speed decreased from 25 to 20.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Striders
- Recipe cost of Striders increased from 150g to 200g.
- Movespeed per charge from 25 to 20 (max of 100 to 80 movespeed).
- All charges removed at 750 range, increased from 600.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Hellbourne Strength Hero: The Benevolent and Merciful King Klout
+ King Klout is an initiation hero who can be a threat from anywhere on the map. Goblin Toss and Bluster can be used together to stack Conscription quickly with your auto-attacks. Parade of Power is an amazing threat from anywhere...if you can aim it correctly!
 
+ The Benevolent and Merciful King Klout began his epic journey as the leader of a troublesome rabble of goblin pickpockets, but he always knew he was destined for something greater. When he obtained the Allowin Crown and Scepter through sheer cunning, courage, and at great risk to life and limb (not necessarily his), he finally ascended to his rightful status as the greatest and most glorious leader throughout all of Newerth, past, present, and future. Huzzah!
 
King Klout Abilities
Ability 1: Goblin Toss
- When learned you get up to 7 minions that follow you around, gaining 1 every 8 seconds.
- The goblins will be Blue, Red, or Green.
- Target an enemy to throw a goblin at them, doing one of three things:
* Blue: Deals 70/90/110/130 Magic Damage, chaining to enemies within 400 radius of the target.
* Red: Deals 30/40/50/60 Magic Damage with another 55/70/85/100 Magic Damage and a 10/15/20/25 Tapering Movespeed Slow over 3 seconds within 200 radius of the target.
* Green: Same as Red, but bounces to two additional nearby enemies.
- When an enemy hero dies near King Klout:
* If King Klout doesn't have 7 minions, King Klout will spawn a new Red Minion.
* If King Klout does have 7 minions, one of the existing minions will be upgraded.
- Every 5th minon spawned is Red.
- There is a 10% chance that when a Blue minion spawns it will be upgraded to a Red minion.
- There is a 25% chance that when a Red minion spawns it will be upgraded to a Green minion.
 
Ability 2: Bluster
- On use and every 2 seconds for the next 6 seconds (4 times total), deals 0/20/40/60 Magic Damage and applies a 1 second Silence and Disarm to all enemies around you.
- Hitting enemy heroes several times will upgrade your minions.
- Every 4 enemy heroes hit results in one of the following effects:
* If King Klout doesn't have 7 minions, King Klout will spawn a new Red Minion.
* If King Klout does have 7 minions, one of the existing minions will be upgraded.
 
Ability 3: Conscription
- All non-DoT damage you deal applies stacks of Conscription, each stack lowering Magic Armor by 0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8.
- When an enemy hero gets 5 Conscription stacks from King Klout they are dealt 20/40/60/80 Magic Damage, Transformed and Slowed for 3 seconds, and one of King Klout's minions is upgraded.
- You cannot build stacks on any target for 5 seconds after they are Transformed.
- Transforming an enemy hero results in one of the following effects:
* If King Klout doesn't have 7 minions, King Klout will spawn a new Red Minion.
* If King Klout does have 7 minions, one of the existing minions will be upgraded.
 
Ability 4: Parade of Power
- Target a direction to fire a projection of King Klout's power in a line.
- Any enemy hit takes up to 150/250/350 Magic Damage and player-controlled units are Feared for up to 1.5/2/2.5 seconds.
- At any time during the initial firing you can use the ability again to teleport to its location, sending another Parade of Power back to where you teleported from.
- Hitting enemy heroes with the initial Parade of Power shot results in 1 of the following effects:
* If King Klout doesn't have 7 minions, King Klout will spawn a new Red Minion.
* If King Klout does have 7 minions, one of the existing minions will be upgraded.
- Parade of Power moves at 1250 speed.
- Parade of Power starts at 75/125/175 Magic Damage and adds an additional 75/125/175 the further the enemy hero is from King Klout.
* At 3500 units away, enemy heroes take maximum damage.
- Fear duration is 0.5 second minimum, adding an additional 1/1.5/2 second(s) the further the enemy hero is from King Klout.
* At 3500 units away, enemy heroes are Feared for the max duration.
* Fear goes through Magic Immunity.

New King Klout Avatar: King Truffle
- Hear ye, all Newerthians! Jin Chan may claim he rules the Rulian Marsh, and the brutish Warlord Flint can boast of how much terror he spreads across the murky waters, but King Truffle is the true lord and master of this vast realm of muck and decay. Those impostors like to bluster about how they are from the Rulian, but King Truffle is actually of the Marsh! Only he can sprout an endless supply of fungal warriors from sentient spores, and only he can travel across the entire quagmire with a single swipe of his scepter! So bow down, terra firma prima donnas, for the true Rulian King has arrived!

New King Klout Debut Avatar: King Klaus
- Ho-ho-hold up a minute â€“ it's Christmas morning and all the presents underneath the World Tree are gone! This has to be the work of that goblin King Klaus and his Selfish Elves, the infamous team of bandits who disguise themselves as holiday heroes just to gain access to homes and steal everything they can, including the coal from the naughty kids. They even put on their own Holiday Parade of Power to get everyone out of the house! Be on the lookout Newerth, because this crew will strut into town and swipe your milk, cookies, and the stockings off your feet and then be gone in a flash!
 
= The Paragons =
+ The Paragons are a faction of ancient, elemental guardians from the isolated Isle of Argentia. They embody the wisdom, emotion, and power of the earth, and the flesh of each Paragon has been overtaken by veins of crystals that hold a strong connection to the planet. They have refused to enter the wars among Man, Beast, and Daemon for fear that if captured, their bodies could be used as conduits to feed death and corruption directly into the earth.
But with King Jeraziah driven to the brink of his faith and needing someone to counter the self-righteous destruction of the URSA Corps, he summons The Paragons, knowing that once they see the state of Newerth they will be forced to join the fight against the Hellbourne as well.
 
New Paragon Wretched Hag Avatar: Alexandrite Wretched Hag
- Alexandrite Paragon is the living manifestation of the balance between the physical world and the magical world, a pure expression of duality whose strong connections to these realms grants her an uncanny intuition for how the enemies of Newerth seek to execute their plans. She and her winged crystal companions always seem to be where the enemy's next step lies, and those poor miscreants should expect no quarter, for the Alexandrite Paragon knows their true intent.

Upgrade:
- The crystal bat gains a wispy blue smoke trail.

- On impact, bats explode from the target and the bat flying above the target's head is more opaque and has blue and purple trails.

- A spiraling trail of purple smoke and an explosion of crystal shards appear as Hag disappears/reappears.

- The effects gain an explosion of bats with purplish wispy trails.
- On reappearance, bats appear and fly inward to form Hag.
 
Sonar Scream Upgrade

Upgrade:

= The War Effort =
 
New War Effort Cycle 12 Trophy Avatar: Trophy Witch Slayer
- The only way to get this rare, auspicious avatar is to be ranked among The War Effort's top 50 or the RANKED MMR Ladder's top 25 players at the end of each 28-day cycle, so keep checking those leaderboards and completing those quests! Even Frostburn Studios staff members cannot get the Trophy avatars!
 
New War Effort Cycle 12 Quest Reward Ophelia Avatar: Pan
- An ancient deity of wild beasts, shepherds and flocks, Pan gazes upon the destruction of all he loves with a broken heart. He can no longer stand idly by while Newerth is stripped of its beauty and turned into a barren wasteland. Calling many formidable beasts to his side, he fills them with his incredible power and strides into battle to fix what has been broken.

= Ultimate =
 
New Ultimate Artesia Avatar: Mechartesia
- The damned self-righteous URSA Corps, sanctimonious Paragons, Saviors, Invaders, and alien Artificers injecting Dark Matter into the veins of Newerth â€“ Klanx had seen enough, especially after witnessing how easily they shattered his creations. After months of prowling the battlefields and salvaging what he could from these new classes of warrior, he retreated to his workshop and began to experiment. Klanx quickly realized there was only one entity on Newerth that could control the levels of destruction he'd uncovered â€“ and she might even survive the experience.

He sent word to the powerful sorceress Artesia that he had found a way to resurrect her lost lover from the Vaults of All Hells â€“ a lie, of course. When Artesia arrived brimming with new hope, Klanx quickly dashed it from her, subdued the sorceress (at the cost of many lackeys and stun grenades) and commenced siphoning her essence of arcane magic. The power was greater than he had hoped. It created an implacable consciousness within the evolving set of armor he had created, an awareness unencumbered by compassion or empathy. Klanx puffed with satisfaction; he had created the perfect weapon for destroying the endless rabble of factions, gods, and corps that all thought they were the answer to Newerth's tribulations. He had melded technology and magic into a terrible, singular arsenal, and he would enjoy watching her fulfill her purpose.

Then Artesia awoke, blasted the narcissistic megalomaniac through a wall and fled before she realized his creation was stirring, rising, and following.

Level Progression
1-5: Apprentice Artesia new in her power, Klanx's magical machine only bears the slightest amount of arcane armor to protect her as she learns and evolves.
6-10: Arcanist Artesia confident in her abilities, the mechanical magician begins donning magical accoutrements designed to help her channel her newfound power through every gear and diode.
11+: Archmage Mechartesia, fully evolved and complete in her absorption of arcane energy, Mechartesia emerges adorned in her full battle gear, resplendently displaying her power and beginning machinations of her own!

- The Hellbourne have all been naughty this year, and since they actually like coal, Santa has decreed they all get a hot, unwrapped can of whup-ass justice for the holiday. Who better to deliver it with speed and a joyous spirit than Blitzen?
 
New Holiday Edition Pebbles Avatar: Boulderdash
- Itâ€™s that time of year again, when the hollering humans are chopping down trees and hanging those damn lights and ugly tinsel over everything, running around messing up the pristine snow with their snowball fights and their annoying youthful attitudes. Well one massive and very grumpy snowman is going to show them what a real snowball fight actually looks like!
 
New Holiday Edition Gladiator Avatar: Gladiclaus 
- You better place wards, you better not feed, you better try hard then CC 15 when Gladiclaus comes to town. This bad-ass list checker will whip you from Naughty to Nice and have you cobbled, wrapped and shipped back to the fountain before heâ€™s done eating your milk and cookies.
 
New Holiday Edition Pearl Avatar: Snowglobe
- Snowglobe spends countless hours creating the idyllic holiday scenes within her precious glass domes, and her Christmas wish is to remake Newerth into a peaceful landscape full of softly glowing lanterns, lofty spires, harmonizing carolers and fluffy, new-fallen snow. For that to happen, however, she must first remove all these grumpy pants more concerned with power and victory than holiday cheer. If she has to break a few globes to make it happen, so be it.

New Valkyrie Avatar: Adkarna Valkyrie
- Jeraziah was wounded, weary, and saw the end looming as he stared into the brimstone depths of a Malphiâ€™s gullet when he was suddenly hidden from view by a Valkyrieâ€™s Prism an instant before a golden lance felled the massive daemon. Because she had saved him from sure death, Jeraziah repaid the fearless warrior with the finest royal armor of Adkarna and a place in his elite guard. Will this newly adorned Valkyrie accept his offer or spread her wings and continue her solitary path?

New Berzerker Avatar: Bloodaxe Berzerker
- There was one clan of Savages who did not bend the knee to Maliken Grimm during the War of the Single Banner. After the massacre at Grimm's Crossing, while the battle-weary Savages chose to bow their cowardly heads rather than die a warrior's death, the Bloodaxe Clan looted Grimm's supplies and slipped away into the Frost Fields. Their northern stronghold became a deathtrap to any threat that wandered too close, but food and offspring dwindled over the years, then ceased altogether as merchants refused to risk the Crossing and daemon raiders skulking among the frozen drifts. With his lineage on the brink of sputtering out forever, the Bloodaxe warlord has ventured out from his refuge to carve out a new home for his clan, and he cares not who his blade must cleave to make it so.
 
New Gemini Avatar: Lion of Sol Gemini
- And the Codex Solaris states: When Newerth cries out in pain, Sol himself shall send his greatest guardian to aid her. The Lion of Sol will plummet from the heavens as a fireball of blinding light, and his tremendous roar shall be heard all across the land. The enemies of Sol will vanish, pulverized by the cascade of his arrival, and all shall witness the might of the one true god.
 
New Pestilence Avatar: Lord Pestilence
- Pestilence betrayed his hive and queen in his quest for power, and in the years since he has sought all forms of insect alchemy and sorcery to continue molting and evolving until he finally emerged as one worthy of ruling everything that swarms, stings, and scuttles. Now he will return to the hive and challenge Moon Queen for her throne, and he brings with him a new brood of pest capable of destroying any who do not submit to their new master.
 
New Wildsoul Avatar: Tigersoul
- The ShÃ o monks of the Monastery of the Way will not speak of the lost brother who delved too deeply into the mystical energies that allow some to take on characteristics of the Beasts. The intent behind this transformation is to gain a better understanding of the animals who share the sun, air and water with the monks. But this man did not seek enlightenment; he wanted to become bigger, stronger, and more ferocious than any other creature in the jungles surrounding the veiled peaks of the Sang-La Mountains. True, he did this to better defend the Monastery and those within, but his motivation was selfish at its core and he became a danger to his fellow monks. Because of this the terrifying creature known as Tigersoul was exiled into the solitary life of a hermit. He and his tiger brethren still defend the Monastery of the Way, but the monk is forever lost to the world of man.

New Paragon Witch Slayer Avatar: Lapis Lazuli Paragon Witch Slayer
- The ancient Lapis Lazuli Paragon is the embodiment of higher intellect and honed mental abilities, and he has devoted these skills to unearthing the true essence of every man, beast, daemon, and spirit he encounters. None can sustain a veil of lies or dishonesty when judged by his crystals, and if they are revealed as a threat to his home or fellow Paragons the sentence is swift and without pity.

= Winter Holidays =

New Holiday Kane Avatar: Candy Kane
- Candy Kane wants everyone to celebrate the holidays as awesomely as he does, but he sometimes has a hard time controlling his enthusiasm and overwhelming strength of spirit. If he sees you bringing any bah humbug attitude to the party, heâ€™ll pull you aside for a little one-on-one time so you can really appreciate how great candy canes are, especially when they aren't bashing your head in.

New Holiday Andromeda Avatar: Christmas Lights Andromeda
- Itâ€™s time to decorate Newerth in lots of bright pretty lights and Andromeda has taken to the tradition like a Pyromancer to fire... almost. Turns out she isnâ€™t very good at untangling the Christmas lights, so be on the lookout for flying comets of pent-up holiday cheer. If youâ€™ve got a plate of cookies and the patience to help her out, sheâ€™ll happily trade places with you and maybe even make you one of her Christmas sweaters. Theyâ€™re very...festive.

New Holiday Riptide Avatar: Yuletide
- The northern pagan tribes of the Frost Fields still celebrate Yuletide despite disapproval from Arasunia and the Church of Sol, but itâ€™s easy for those Martyrs and Sisters of Sol to dismiss the winter holiday from afar. When the ancient Yuletide creature emerges from the frozen waters looking to share holiday cheer, it is best to have your home strung with holly, ivy, and boughs of evergreen and a handmade gift ready for exchange. This is because Yuletide has a much darker, more dangerous sideâ€”the reason his worshipers and holiday have survived while others have not.

New Holiday Rhapsody Avatar: Christmas Carol
- Carry the holiday hymns and melodies throughout the lanes with Christmas Carol, who protects her fellow carolers as gracefully and tenaciously as her priceless vocal cords. Caroling etiquette is strictly enforced, so know the lyrics, stick together in the jungle, and if you enjoyed the song, show some harping appreciation! 

New Holiday Amun-Ra Avatar: Bask in My Presents Ra
- Every year around the holidays the giving spirit is ignited within Amun-Ra and he is reborn from an abomination of all that is light and holy into a delightful example of generosity and giving. Delightful, that is, as long as you accept his gifts with an appreciative smile no matter whatâ€™s inside. And donâ€™t bother asking for a gift receipt. Ra burned them all.

= Community Event Team =

+ Here to bring you HoN-related events with huge prizes!
+ Amun-Ra was in dire need of flavor tooltips. The following submissions have won, and the players who submitted them get an Amun-Ra avatar of their choice!
- Path of Destruction [Q] - Who needs direct pathing? (Submitted by ShajiWhyUGay)
- Ignite [W] - Happens when you're eating flaming hot Cheetos. (Submitted by Dota`1)
- Ashes to Ashes [E] - I was voted the hottest guy in Newerth. (Submitted by i99StrPurePK)
- Pyroclasmic Rebirth [R] - Round Two, FIGHT! (Submitted by ElVasilisk)

+ Nome's Wisdom was lacking lore and Galaxy wrote the winning submission.
- Rumor spread throughout the Forests of Caldavar that a new relic had been conjured by the crazed alchemist Nome. The artifact radiated a rejuvenating aura that soothed even the deepest wounds from battle. Now, with the war for control getting increasingly intense, both Hellbourne and Legion desperately tried utilizing the unique item and quickly added it to their arsenals.

+ Energizer was also lacking lore, but no longer, thanks to Mithra's submission.
- Craving power without end, Newerth's best magicians finally evoked this mystical artifact. Although simple of design, this device enabled both the Hellbourne hordes and the Legion armies to move with speed unparalleled by anything known before. The appearance of Blitz was only a natural consequence, perceiving a challenge he could best.

= Gold Collection =

New Gold Collection Legionnaire Avatar: Mercenary Legionnaire
+ Mercenary Legionnaire brings a new type of interaction to Newerth! This avatar includes a Legion and Hellbourne version, and the appropriate character will display in-game depending on which team you join. Each version has its own Legion and Hellbourne model, texture, effects, voice, and sound effects.
- Legionnaires are the namesakes of the Legion itself, and when they take the battlefield with their massive battle-axes, the razor-sharp blades blessed by the fiery blood of the Sacred Order, there is no daemon who can stand before their terrifying charge. But when these courageous warriors do fall, their corpses are like treasure to the Hellbourne, who claim the lifeless meat and bone as their own and imbue it with a corrupted essence. The result is a bastardized shell of the former Legion soldier, a depraved murderer whose only desire is to retrace his former life's steps, killing everyone who had a hand in forging the Legion hero he once was.

= The War Effort =

New War Effort Cycle 11 Avatar: Blade of Sol Jeraziah
If a Man does sin against Sol, let him be punished, and his children also, and their children also, unto the last of them, for no good springs of evil.
â€“ The Codex Solaris
- Sol is a vengeful god, and Jeraziah has long felt the punishment for the sins of his father. The young prince tried to embrace the benevolent side of his faith for years, even after he became king, but that only led to suffering and heartbreak. No more. Behold Jeraziah, the Blade of Sol, who draws the blessed, razor-honed sword of righteousness against all who deny Sol's word. He is imbued with his god's pure light and power, and while those who stand beside him certainly appreciate his protection and blessing, his only motivation for keeping them alive is so they can kill more sinners before finally ascending to Sol's ultimate glory.

= Winter Holidays =

New Holiday Edition Gravekeeper Avatar: Holidaykeeper Hestia
- Gather 'round, Newerth family, for the hearth is warm and the household safe from the dangers of the outside world thanks to the grace and generosity of Holidaykeeper Hestia! Leave the war behind you, raise your glasses, and offer your first and last libations of the feast in her honor, for she has brought us all here, friend and foe alike, to sit within her sanctuary when the cold night is at its darkest.

New Holiday Edition Ward: Thanksgiving Ward
- Provide your team with a cornucopia of map awareness with the Thanksgiving ward! 

= Loi Krathong/Yi Peng =

New Holiday Edition Bombardier Avatar: Yi Peng Bombardier
- Yi Peng Bombardier is ready to celebrate the full moon festival by floating some explosively fun sky lanterns for the opposition to enjoy! Her brightly burning candle lights the way for all to find peace, and when she releases a khom loi even the angriest players feel compelled to let go of hatred, anger, and corruption. Happy Yi Peng and Loi Krathong, Newerth! 

= General =

New Maliken Avatar: Adkarna King Maliken
- With Calamity attempting to begin the Third Corruption, the Great Rift threatening, the return of the Paragons, and Parallax skewing time and space around him, an alternate reality has woven into Newerth as we know it.
In this reality, Malikenâ€™s first love Andraste did not die giving birth to Jeraziah. As a result, Maliken never fell under the spell of the shapeshifter Sylvia and his mind remained untouched by the madness that drove him to begin the Second Corruption. But the Second Corruption happened regardless, caused by Sylvia's daughter Ophelia, who would take any measure to wipe Man off the face of Newerth. Emperor Maliken will march from Adkarna in full regalia to rally the Legion against this wicked girl and her bestial daemons!

New Arachna Avatar: Arachnae
- Arachnae was the finest weaver in all of ancient Greece, and all who saw her work remarked at how lucky she was to receive such a gift from Athena, goddess of wisdom and crafts. Arachnae scoffed at this, claiming her skill surpassed even Athena's and that the goddess had no part in her abilities. Athena heard each of these insults, and when they became too much to bear she challenged Arachnae to a weaving contest with the loser banished from the loom for all of time. Arachnae accepted.
The two wove feverishly for hours, and when they were done Athena lifted hers for all to witness. It was a glorious tapestry of Zeus and his siblings defeating the Titans, a worthy homage to the Titanomachy, and the gathered crowd was ready to name it the winner. Then Arachnae revealed her tapestry, a breathtaking mosaic featuring infamous scenes in which the gods had tricked, abused, and slaughtered mortals. The crowd was silent, but secretly approved of this challenge to the gods.
Athena was not quite as impressed. Infuriated by this insult to the gods, as well as the proof that Arachnae was indeed a better weaver, she said, "Since you are so fond of weaving, let's see if you can weave your way out of the Underworld."
She laid her hand upon Arachnae's head and transformed her into a hideous half-human, half-spider monstrosity and sent her to the lowest level of the Underworld, where no loom or fabric exists. Since that day Arachnae has been weaving a web to climb back to the land of the mortals, and when the Second Corruption ripped the land apart and unleashed the Underworld upon Newerth, Arachnae crawled out, seeking vengeance upon the gods and those who worship them. 

New Courier: Fairy Courier
- This Fairy Courier seeks to return the kindness you performed by freeing her by bringing your items on wings of speed!

Ellonia
- Ellonia's Absolute Zero (boosted by Staff of the Master) now applies level 4 Flash Freeze to all targets hit by the return projectile.
* Fixes a corner case bug so that Circe's mimic of Ellonia (when Ellonia has Staff of the Master) will properly apply Flash Freeze to the appropriate targets hit if the mimic dies before the projectile returns to the mimic's position.

Engineer
- Soaker Rosie Engineer's overhead visuals no longer move down vertically whenever she moves.
- Steam Turret damage effect type changed from Magic to Magic DoT.

Flint Beastwood
- Rulian Warlord's attack projectile visuals will now properly change when attacking units depending on the items he has in his inventory.

Forsaken Archer
- Split Fire split attack range now matches her increased Attack Range when she has a Wingbow in her inventory.

Glacius
- Zircon Paragon Glacius' Chilling Presence upgrade now shows the correct pulse visuals.

Gravekeeper
- Defiling Touch corpses no longer block neutral creeps from spawning.

Kane
- Septar Kane's Steel Resolve eye visual on the target now displays properly.

Lodestone
- Lodestone Plates now functions properly if the hero source damaging Lodestone is invulnerable.
- Rocket Drill lifetime is now properly adjusted if Lodestone is affected by Moira's Arcane Vortex.
* Prevents Lodestone moving to the bottom-left corner of the map because the Rocket Drill gadget no longer expires prematurely if Lodestone is affected by Arcane Vortex.

Midas
- Sterling Midas' Elemental Warp now plays the proper sound file if the player owns a level 4 or above upgrade for Sterling Midas.

Moraxus
- Moraxus will now properly use his corresponding avatar's axe model when More Axes is triggered from his Matraxe skill that is boosted by Staff of the Master.

Nitro
- Mauser will no longer die on the same frame if he becomes invulnerable when returning to Nitro.

Pharaoh
- Pharaoh's Hellfire visuals now match its actual radius.

Prisoner 945
- The Virtue set effect for Temperance Prisoner no longer displays a shell that appears similar to the Double Damage rune visuals.
- Bajie throws his rake now instead of a ball.

Rhapsody
- Tourmaline Paragon Rhapsody's Protective Melody now breaks properly when channeling is cancelled by a Stun or Silence, if the user owns the Protective Melody Paragon visual upgrade and Rhapsody has a Staff of the Master in her inventory.
- Protective Melody's channel bar now hides properly when channeling is cancelled by a Stun or Silence if Rhapsody has a Staff of the Master in her inventory.

Riftwalker
- No longer teleports to the bottom-left corner of the map with the second usage of Bidirectional Wormhole (ultimate skill, boosted by Staff of the Master) if Moira's Arcane Vortex affects Riftwalker before the second usage is actually used.

Succubus
- Ultimate renamed from "Succubus' Hold" to "Cursed Embrace."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.7.13
-------------
3 November 2015

== Design ==

= General =

Safechanneling Option
- When this option is enabled, you will not cancel your own Homecoming Stone or Post Haste teleport unless you push stop or hold.

Ability Cast Priorities
- Targeting has been improved for all ability casts. All abilities will now ignore invalid targets on mouse over and click allowing you to click through enemies to target allies with friendly target abilities and vice versa.

Right Click Deny Option
- When this option is enabled, right clicking an allied creep or hero that is low enough health to deny will cause you to attack them. (YAY IT'S FINALLY IN)

= Courier =

Courier
+ Based on survey results and other feedback, weâ€™ve decided to increase the speed of the courier. We are still looking at improvements to the courier, but this change was a very simple one.
- Courier movespeed increased from 400 to 522 while delivering.
- Added trail effect while delivering.

= Items =

Health Potion
+ With the new courier system, we knew we would need to think about Health Potions as a constant source of regeneration. Ferrying health potions to suicides and to jungle heroes turned out to be too effective. With the speed of the courier increasing, this change is needed to maintain the balance of suicides and jungle heroes.
- Now has a 120 second cooldown.
* Still has no cooldown in Mid Wars.

= Heroes =

Gauntlet
- Can now detach early from his Gauntlet Punch's (R, boosted by Staff of the Master) flying fist with a secondary activation.
* This removes his invulnerability state early and allows him to act sooner as per the player's decision.

Ravenor
+ We have had a good amount of time to look at Ravenor with his current changes and we have evaluated his usefulness in the jungle and his ability to gain charges with his ultimate. The jungle farm was just a little too fast, and we wanted to make a jungle Ravenor spend a considerable amount of health and mana to accomplish it. The Storm Blades attack speed was always there to make it feel better as you played with it, but the new Static Shock will do that nicely so the need for it on the Storm Blades wasn't necessary. We also decided that players were gaining charges a little too quickly.

Storm Blades
- No longer grants a bonus 50 attack speed.

Static Shock
- Reworded tooltips to change the bonus percentages against non-hero units into a bonus damage multiplier (+300% = 4x damage, +250% = 3.5x damage).
- Bonus damage multiplier against non-hero units decreased from 4X to 3X.

Power Overwhelming
- Minimum charge amount decreased from 25 to 15.
- Charge per hit decreased from 7 to 5.

= The Paragons =
+ The Paragons are a faction of ancient, elemental guardians from the isolated Isle of Argentia. They embody the wisdom, emotion, and power of the earth, and the flesh of each Paragon has been overtaken by veins of crystals that hold a strong connection to the planet. They have refused to enter the wars among Man, Beast, and Daemon for fear that if captured, their bodies could be used as conduits to feed death and corruption directly into the earth.
But with King Jeraziah driven to the brink of his faith and needing someone to counter the self-righteous destruction of the URSA Corps, he summons The Paragons, knowing that once they see the state of Newerth they will be forced to join the fight against the Hellbourne as well.

Paragon Upgrades
+ Each Paragon avatar can be upgraded up to 5 times by acquiring upgrades.
+ Upgrades will become available in the Paragon Chest in Plinko after you own the respective Paragon Avatar.

New Paragon Revenant Avatar: Sapphire Paragon Revenant
- The Sapphire Paragon is a calm, focused guardian who embraces order and structure, and in her world there is no place for ill magic or the plague of the Hellbourne. The gems she carries are only slightly softer than diamonds, and true to form the Sapphire Paragon will shatter before she bends to the daemonic forces of destruction.

Sapphire Paragon Revenant Upgrades:
- Defile Upgrade:
* Allies and self gain an extra ring of crystal pieces that glow and rotate around the character.
* Wisps of energy float off of the character.
* On hitting an enemy, extra crystal pieces fly off of the enemy.
* When slowed, extra wisps of energy float off and crystals pierce the ground underneath the character.
- Mortification Upgrade:
* A crystal ring expands from the center of the afflicted target and grows to the outer regions of the area of effect. 
- Essence Shroud Upgrade:
* The target the spell is cast upon gains a dazzling glow and extra crystals growing out of them. 
- Manifestation Upgrade:
* Crystals rise up from the ground and float skyward around Revenant. 
- Carnage Counter Upgrade: Dazzle all of Newerth with a running display of your all-time kills and assists with your Paragon avatars!

New Paragon Taunt
- Entomb your fallen foes in a Paragon crystal crypt!
- Eligibility: Paragon Empath, Paragon Parasite, Paragon Riftwalker, Paragon Rhapsody, Paragon Glacius, Paragon Revenant

= Gold Collection =

New Gold Collection Gauntlet Avatar: Polyphemus
- After millennia of loathing and hatred for the treacherous swine Odysseus for plunging a wooden stake into his eye and blinding him, the gigantic cyclops Polyphemus has had his sight restored to him by his mother, Thoosa. His father Poseidon also equipped him with an incredibly powerful weapon known as the â€˜God-Hand,â€™ a device built with infernal wrath in mind. Odysseus may be long dead, but humankind will answer for his malefaction. Polyphemus has left his lonely island to seek vengeance, and although his sight has returned, he is fueled by pure blind rage. 

= The War Effort =

New War Effort Cycle 10 Avatar: Trophy Magmus
- This rare and auspicious avatar can be obtained by being ranked among The War Effort's top 50 at the end of the 28-day cycle. In addition to the Quest Ladder, Trophy Avatars will also be given to the Top 25 players on the Ranked MMR Ladder! Whether it be Quests or MMR, keep climbing that ladder because you don't want to miss out! Even the staff can't get the Trophy avatars!

= General =

New Torturer Avatar: Mermaid
- When a brave sailor of the Hollow Sea is lost to the cold, black waters, tradition demands that his widow -- or her widower -- must wrap their body in chains and anchors and join their drowned loved one at the bottom of sea. When these distraught souls cannot find each other, the Hollow Sea resurrects them as mermaids and mermen and compels them to ask of every ship passing by, "Have you seen my beloved?" Wise sailors offer gifts of rum and silver and point to the east, while the foolish whisper prayers to their gods or ignore the pleading spirits. These poor sods get to witness the wrathful side of the mermaids and men, and their spouses soon don the chains and anchors to join them. 

New Fayde Avatar: Persephone
- Abducted by Hades and imprisoned within his underworld kingdom, Persephone initially tried to break free like the spring shoots and blossoms she adored and tended as a young daughter of Zeus and Demeter. But as the years passed and she witnessed the violence of gods and men, the afflictions they set upon each other as they squandered the precious life and freedom that had been stolen from her, she became disillusioned with the mortal world and no longer sought to be among the living. Instead, she grew obsessed with punishing those who were condemned to the underworld by their own fell deeds. She became an embodiment of misfortune and carried the curses of men among their shades, harvesting hope with a terrible swiftness, and when Hades learned of this he knew she was finally ready to be unleashed upon the living. For the flocks need culling, and the underworld always needs more souls.

New Nymphora Avatar: Beelzebub
- Beelzebub is a fallen angel who, during the War in Heaven, was cast into Hell where she became Chief Lieutenant to Lucifer and Queen of The Order of the Fly. She is known to use her daemonic powers of compulsion to make men worship her, to excite priests to lust, to cause chaos on a city-wide scale, and to foment war between nations. In battle she uses her endless swarms of ravenous flies to surround and drag her prey ever closer for the kill.

New Keeper of the Forest Avatar: Keeper of the Harvest
- Every autumn, as the cold winds of the Frost Fields begin to sigh over the Iron Mountains, the Forests of Caldavar become an open pantry for those seeking food and fuel for the winter. Of course Nature is bountiful and generous and welcomes this gathering of her gifts, but to ensure she has enough left to begin anew the following spring, she summons the Keeper of the Harvest. This sage guardian keeps a constant vigil among the changing foliage and scurrying chiprels, and any who try to reap beyond what Nature can spare will quickly find themselves condemned to a cold, dark afterlife - a winter from which they will never wake.

New Taunt: Slap the Troll
- Donâ€™t feed the trolls - smack them down with this epic troll-slapping taunt!

Version 3.7.12
-------------
20 October 2015

== Design ==

= New Game Mode =

Devo Wars
+ We are finally bringing a classic game mode into HoN's matchmaking! Over the last few months we have polished and enhanced the traditional gameplay into an exciting experience.
+ Devo Wars map information and tips are shown while loading and queuing for a Devo Wars game. 
* http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/devowars
Here is a list of the rules for Devo Wars and how it differs from other gameplay modes:

Pick Mode:
- Everyone is Devourer!

How to Win:
- First team to 60 kills wins the game.
- Match will end at 20 minutes if 60 kills are not reached, awarding the win to the team with the higher number of kills.

Map:
- Devo Wars takes place on a very small map with a river in the middle you cannot walk across, but can get hooked across!
- Shops are located in the back-middle of each side.
- There is a large pillar in the middle of the map off of which the hooks will bounce.
- There are four posts on the map located on each corner near the river. These block movement, but not hooks or vision.
* These posts can be hit by the Grappling Hook if you buy the item.

Rules:
- The first 15 seconds of each game is the time to purchase items, during which a player cannot move or use abilities.
* There are sixteen items to choose from. Explore the options and see what you like the most!
- Each Devourer has only one ability: Chain Hook.
- Each of the following upgrades can be leveled any number of times, but you still cap at level 25.
- Chain Hook can be upgraded in four ways:
* Damage: Base of 250 and each level adds 15.
* Range: Base of 1600 and each level adds 120.
* Speed: Base of 1100 and each level adds 40.
* Touch Radius: Base of 70 and each level adds 5.
- Chain Hook bounces off walls.
- Hooking a Devourer that is being dragged by someone else will instantly kill (or deny) them!
- Respawn time lowered to ~3-5 seconds at all levels.
- When you respawn, you are invulnerable for 2.5 seconds.
- Runes spawn every 20 seconds and move down the river.
- Runes must be hooked to get their effects.
- Types of Runes:
* Time Rune: Grants +150 Movement Speed for 12 seconds.
* Electric Hook Rune: Your next hook will instantly kill the first enemy it hits. Don't miss!
* Bomb Rune: Puts a bomb buff on yourself. After 5 seconds, enemies around you take damage and are stunned.
* Split Hook Rune: Your next hook launches three Chain Hooks instead of one.
* Coin Rune: Instantly gives you +100 Gold.

= Player Appreciation =
+ October is Player Appreciation Month and this year we will be starting the process of running through all of our old avatar sets and giving them each new, updated set effects. We will be implementing effects for four different sets each patch until we run out.

Here are the first four sets that will receive effects:

+ Halloween music from 2014 added with six new tracks.

= The Paragons =
+ The Paragons are a faction of ancient, elemental guardians from the isolated Isle of Argentia. They embody the wisdom, emotion, and power of the earth, and the flesh of each Paragon has been overtaken by veins of crystals that hold a strong connection to the planet. They have refused to enter the wars among Man, Beast, and Daemon for fear that if captured, their bodies could be used as conduits to feed death and corruption directly into the earth.
But with King Jeraziah driven to the brink of his faith and needing someone to counter the self-righteous destruction of the URSA Corps, he summons The Paragons, knowing that once they see the state of Newerth they will be forced to join the fight against the Hellbourne as well.

New Paragon Glacius Avatar: Zircon Paragon Glacius
- The Zircon Paragon is the eldest of the elemental guardians, and his gems have witnessed every moment of pain since life first appeared on the planet. As a result, the Zircon Paragon seeks to protect the innocent against suffering, evil, and negative energies. Entombing the daemons causing the suffering, evil, and negative energy in crypts of Zircon is a great way to start.

Paragon Upgrades
+ Each Paragon avatar can be upgraded up to 5 times by acquiring upgrades
+ Upgrades will become available in the Paragon Chest in Plinko after you own the respective Paragon Avatar.

Zircon Paragon Glacius Upgrades:
- Tundra Blast Upgrade: A crystal burst of energy over zircon crystal spikes in the area of effect.
- Ice Imprisonment Upgrade: Zircon crystals encase the body of the affected target.
- Chilling Presence Upgrade: Zircon energy pulses underneath the affected heroes.
- Glacial Downpour Upgrade: Energy swirls around the falling ice shards while zircon crystal spikes form in the area of effect.
- Carnage Counter Upgrade: Dazzle all of Newerth with a running display of your all-time kills and assists with your Paragon avatars!

Paragon Trail of Magic
- The enchanted path of the Paragons is only visible to those who are worthy!
- Eligibility: Paragon Empath, Paragon Parasite, Paragon Riftwalker, Paragon Rhapsody, Paragon Glacius

= Halloween =

New Halloween Tarot Avatar: Trick-or-Treat Tarot
- Born with a golden spoon in her mouth to go along with an insatiable sweet tooth, this young lady has always looked forward to Halloween because her clairvoyance shows which of her rich neighbors have the best candy (and she knows it's really Devo beneath that bedsheet). If they don't want to give up the goods, she's ready and willing to bind them all together and bounce from house to house, drawing the full-size candy bars and sacks of peanut butter cups. Sure, she could just go out and buy the sweets herself, but paying for power is for chumps and she wouldn't get a chance to show off her wildly expensive Halloween party outfit! The only downside of being this clever and clairvoyant is that no one can ever trick her with Halloween fun.

New Halloween Ward: Batty
- Never be blind as a bat with this full moon Halloween ward shining!

= General =

New Flint Beastwood Avatar: Hired Gun Flint
+ Hired Gun Flint brings a new type of interaction to Newerth! In order to escape after executing his contracts, Hired Gun Flint changes into one of eight disguises. In the rare case he's on the wrong end of a hit, he respawns in his stylish base suit and tie.
- Flint Beastwood is tired of earning puny Creep bounties and ransacking the bodies of his victims, so heâ€™s gone professional, complete with a finely tailored suit and full wardrobe of disguises so he can approach his victims undetected and escape any pursuit. His lethal services are available to the highest bidder, and if you plunk down the cash, you get a body. It might be your body, but nobody said Flint was a good businessman.

New Devourer Avatar: Keelhaul
- There are few sailors of the Hollow Sea brave or stupid enough to whisper of The Maw, the deepest oceanic trench upon Newerth's scarred landscape. Those who can muster the courage to mention it speak only myth and rumor, for any vessel unlucky enough to actually gaze into the churning abyss is pulled to its black depths forever...or until The Maw decides to regurgitate them, drowned, twisted and deformed by the crushing pressure and insidious consciousness of the void.
The notorious admiral of the Legion's Armada called Captain Keelhaul by his crew (though never to his face) was infamous for his strict discipline and harsh punishments, and when he planned to toss a forbidden barrel of rum overboard his sailors could stand no more. They mutinied, dragging the admiral along the keel as they sailed over The Maw, and when the rough hemp rope grew slack and the frayed end was pulled from the dark waters with no corpse attached, the crew thought that was the last anyone would see of Keelhaul. But The Maw found a perfect soldier in the admiral, whose fury only increased as his body was twisted and transformed in the black depths, and when The Maw spat him back into the world of the living, Keelhaul had a ship's worth of scores to settle.

New Rally Avatar: Blightstalker Rally
- The Blight Fields were once known as the Fields of Light, a glorious and sacrosanct cemetery for the citizens of Hope's Keep. Now it is a wasteland corrupted by the nearby Scar and the constant eruption of Krula, which looms above the landscape spewing soot and cinder into the sky. But the grand mausoleums that once made the Fields of Light into a small city -- albeit a very quiet one -- are full of untold treasures and relics buried with the men and women who once ruled Hope's Keep, and the Blightstalkers risk their lives to venture deep into the zones of corruption. They make every attempt to equip themselves against any threat, but one can never know what horror they will encounter in the Blight Fields, be it mutated, spectral, daemonic or completely beyond classification.

New Puppet Master Avatar: King Minos
- This is Minos at the height of his mortal power, when he was on a mission to avenge the death of his son Androgeos, who died fighting a bull at Marathon. After causing havoc across all of Hellas, he asked his father Zeus to punish Attica and the god ravaged the city with plague and hunger. This drove Athens to obey any command from Minos to avoid the same fate, and he demanded that each year they send seven young boys and seven young girls to him so he could throw them into his labyrinth to be eaten by the Minotaur.
Now, as a judge of the dead, Minos has the ability to summon his former self and wield the burning vengeance and incredibly manipulative powers of King Minos, and his pet Minotaur shall never go hungry!

New Scout Avatar: Adkarna Assassin
- Not all Scouts of the Hidden Village choose to operate beneath the protective and familiar canopies of the forests and jungles of Newerth; some are called to the crowded, clamorous streets of Adkarna, the Legion capitol that provides its own civilized versions of survival of the fittest. Though they are far from home, their Scout mission to eliminate the Hellbourne threat remains the same, for Adkarna is infested with daemon spies, deceivers, and assassins constantly seeking opportunities to disrupt the Legion cause. These infiltrators believe they are invisible, a shadow among the masses, until the moment when the Scout blade severs their spine.

New Calamity Avatar: Rhadamanthus
- It was her ruthless, iron-clad sense of integrity that earned Rhadamanthus a seat as one of the Three Judges of All Hells, but she was supplanted and imprisoned by Abaddon and the other two judges, Minos and Aeacus, when they became suspicious that Rhadamanthus was more concerned with feeding her pet daemons the flesh and souls of the damned than dispensing proper underworld justice. When Calamity brought about the Third Corruption and unleashed the vengeful Rhadamanthus from her torturous vault, the former judge began stalking Newerth, fixated on the opportunity to exact a final ruling upon those who betrayed her.

New POGs Avatar: Puppet Master
- These high-definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.


== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

= General =
- Improved resource unloading.
- Certain pick screen visuals have been fixed to match other game modes.
- Compatized replays will now play properly.
- Mega Creeps will no longer instantly gain maximum movespeed.

= Heroes=
Accursed
- Lord of Locusts Fire Shield visual no longer spins faster than it should.

Deadlift
- Resurrection no longer continues to channel if the skill was used on a target position more than 250 units away from the Gravestone, even after the targeted Gravestone dies.
* As a result, the Gravestone's hero will no longer revive that hero at the bottom-left corner of the map.
- No longer resurrects the target hero and moves to the bottom-left corner of the map if the targeted hero accepts the Resurrection prompt after the channel ends.

Empath
- Empath no longer leaves behind a green wispy shadow when she dies while having a Staff of the Master in her inventory.

Engineer
- Soaker Rosie's in-game 3D portrait visuals have been fixed.

Fayde
- Mana burn pop-up now shows the proper value.
- Reflection no longer plays an animation when used.

Martyr
- Damage stored by Guardian Angel is now displayed as charges on the buff as a percentage of the target's maximum health.
* Charges are capped at 100, even though the actual damage can go above that.

Midas
- Sterling Midas Elemental Warp sounds will no longer be excessively loud if it hits a large number of enemy units.
* Applies to both the first affector spawned & the second affector spawned.

Nitro
- Ballistic no longer uses slower attack projectiles from Attack Modifiers like Harkon's Blade or Frostwolf's Skull.

Parallax
- Planet Cracker (ultimate boosted by Staff of the Master) now properly has the 1-second cooldown before Parallax can toggle the skill off.

Tarot
- Ricochet properly continues bouncing if it finds a valid bounce target when the original target disjoints the first hit of Ricochet.

Version 3.7.11
-------------
6 October 2015

== Design ==

Chronos
+ A quick fix to his bashes that were not being seen enough throughout the game.

Curse of Ages
- Chance to proc increased from 5/6/7/8% per charge to 6.5/9/11.5/14% per charge
- Now guarantees at proc upon obtaining 8/7/7/6 charges (lowered from 12)
- Fixed a bug where the ability's timer was set to 0 upon obtaining the final charge value without proccing (such as by attacking a tower)
* This unintentionally rendered Chronos able to hold onto his charge for a guaranteed proc like pre-3.7.10.


Nitro
+ The hero has a lot of skill involved to reach her peaks. We knew going into retail she would be a hard hero to master but she would have a high pay off. In the end she still needs a bit of a boost to put her with the other heroes that require a high skill level to play effectively.

- Starting Agility increased from 20 to 25

Ballistic
- Ballistic's projectile touch radius increased from 75 to 90

Divide and Conquer
- Mauser Magic Armor increased from 5 to 7


Zephyr
+ A followup nerf to bring the hero's farming back in check and to make him earn more of his farm rather than have it freely given. We will continue to keep an eye on zephyr and change him accordingly to make sure everyone is happy with his place in the pool.

Gust
- Range lowered from 800 to 700

Cyclones
- Damage lowered from 6/9/12/15 to 7/8/9/10
- Cyclones will no longer passively spawn if you have taken damage in the last 20 seconds.

Wind Shield
- Passive deflection has been reduced from 15 to 10

New Scar Hellbringer Avatar: Arimane the Pit Lord
- The Hellbringers are fearsome summoners who pull forth the most powerful daemons to serve their infernal cause. Most of them are men and women corrupted by the power of dark magic, but some summoners find themselves drawn from the ranks of the daemons themselves. Those elite Hellbringers are known as the Pit Lords, so named because they alone have the ability to summon their brethren and bend them to their will. Among the Pit Lords one holds sway above all others: Arimane. He alone has bound the daemon princes of Tartarus to his will and he alone knows the true names of the other Pit Lords. Inscribed in blood in his book of souls, Arimane will not hesitate to bind anyone who threatens his power to his will.
Freed from Hell to walk directly on the mortal plane through the Scar, Arimane now seeks to add more names to his book of souls and continue to increase the size of his own personal army.

New Scar Night Hound Avatar: Fright Hound
- The Fright Hounds were thought to only be terrifying legends, myths created by superstitious soldiers who were afraid to venture into the darkness while on watch. Now those soldiers are faced with two horrifying possibilities: either the myths were true, or their worst nightmares have come to life. The Fright Hounds have loped out of The Scar with their carcass blades sharpened and ready to rend flesh, and while their appearance is hideous enough to send grizzled veterans running, the soldiers would rather have the chance to run than have their guts ripped out before they even know the stealthy daemons are within striking range.

New Scar Bushwack Avatar: Cesspool
- Cesspool spent endless years stalking the blackest corners of the pits of hell, capturing the most vile, noxious daemons and extracting their toxins so he could inject them into the helpless, damned souls wandering through the veils of the underworld. Their constant screams were gratifying, but ultimately unfulfilling since they could not give him the reward all predators crave: death. When the Second Corruption tore the earth apart and let the daemons spill across Newerth like pus from a burst boil, Cesspool found a vast hunting ground full of fleshy targets who succumbed to death with shocking ease. As a result, he's diluted his toxins to prolong the effect so he can enjoy it for as long as possible before his victims give their final scream of anguish.

New Scar Prophet Avatar: Amadea
- Once a peasant girl who used her gift of second sight to protect her village from fire, famine and raiders, Amadea discovered a much greater power growing beneath the surface at the base of Krula when her family harvested the obsidian found there. By linking to this power she was able to not only see the potential threats, but destroy them. And so it was when Maliken Grimm broke the land apart with The Second Corruption, the insidious daemonic energy was already entangled within Amadea's flesh, blood, and soul -- the innocent peasant girl was already Hellbourne.

New Scar Valkyrie Avatar: SvÃ¡na
- SvÃ¡na died defending her homeland in the fierce battle against Glacius and his minions, and she had barely touched the grass in the fields of the afterlife before she demanded to be reborn. "It is not yet your time to return," the goddess Freyja told her. SvÃ¡na seemed to accept this, but when the dead warriors began passing mead and telling their tales she hid within the chariot that carried the moon across the sky. As it passed over Newerth, SvÃ¡na dropped from the chariot and drifted to the battlefield where her corpse lay. She willed it to rise, to fight again, but the cold flesh did not stir. SvÃ¡na was so distraught that when the man in the cloak approached and offered her another chance at battle and glory, she did not hesitate. Nor did she ask the price. And so Jaru the Corrupted Disciple pulled her soul into the simmering Scar, and when she emerged she was SvÃ¡na of the Scar, reborn with a terrifying dead light burning within her.

22 September 2015

THE DEATH PROWLERS

== Design ==

+ The focus of this balance patch lies in two places:
- To further diversify our hero pool and readjust changes made from the previous big balance patch.
- Alter some of the overarching game systems to promote more healthy gameplay in both normal and casual mode.


== New Hero ==

New Legion Agility Hero: Nitro
- Nitro is a fragile but powerful carry hero who shines most when they stay far away from opponents, peppering them with Ballistic shots while hidden behind the forest's shroud of trees. Nitro has the rare trait of not having a right-click auto attack; in its place they have Ballistic, which allows them to shoot a long-range attack while moving.

= Nitro Lore =

The Death Prowlers are a tribe of bandits from the southern fringes of The Great Waste. Long before the Legion of Man and Beast Horde warily joined forces against the Hellbourne, the Death Prowlers worked as close tandems of human and creature, forming agile hit-and-run teams that survive by maximizing the benefits of strategy and instinct, intelligence and savagery. Their bond is lifelong and essential for survival--if one dies, the other cannot bear to live.
Even in a tribe of rambunctious bandits, the duo known as Nitro stands out as a live wire. This hunter-killer team is a perfect blend of aggression and composure. The driver, Mauser, knows exactly how to move and position the team for optimal kinetic impact, while the gunner, Psychopop, just likes to blow stuff up.

= Nitro Attacks & Abilities =

Psychopop (Gunner) & Mauser (Driver)

Ability 1: Ballistic
- Nitro fires a long-range attack in the target direction.
- Activate to fire an attack toward the cursor that hits up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 enemies, dealing Nitro's attack damage to all enemies hit.
- If the target is an enemy hero, Nitro gains a charge granting 10 Attack Speed. Max 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 charges.
- Mana cost of Ballistic increases by 1 mana per hero level of Nitro.
- If detached from Mauser, range is increased to 1500.
- Item proc effects work only on the first enemy hit with Ballistic.
- Ballistic is a replacement for Nitro's Auto Attack.
- Ballistic's cooldown is tied to Nitro's attack cooldown.

Ability 2: Divide & Conquer / Lock & Load
- Divide & Conquer (Attached)
* Nitro detaches from Mauser, sending him to melee attack their enemies.
- Lock & Load (Separated)
* Mauser teleports and reattaches to Nitro.
- Activate to cause Nitro to detach from Mauser, sending him to target location.
- Passively gain bonus damage on Ballistic equal to 0, 1, 2.5, 4, 5.5% of the distance traveled by Ballistic.
- While detached, Nitro is immobilized and Ballistic range is increased to 1500.
- In addition, control is switched over to Mauser who inherits attributes equal to 100% plus 2 x Nitro's level in damage.
- If Mauser is killed, Nitro will also perish.
- Divide and Conquer can be cast while silenced.
- Activate again to initiate Lock & Load.

Ability 3: Runaround
- Nitro and Mauser burst with energy becoming evasive and slowing nearby enemies.
- Activate to cause Nitro and Mauser to gain 100% Evasion for 2.5, 3.25, 4, 4.75 seconds.
- While Runaround is active, Nitro and Mauser receive an aura that applies a 20, 25, 30, 35% Movement Speed slow to nearby enemy units.
- Runaround cannot be cast if either Nitro or Mauser are silenced or stunned.

Ability 4: HEAT Round (High Explosive Anti-Tank)
- Ballistic applies stacks that can detonate.
- Passively causes Ballistic to apply HEAT Round stacks to enemy heroes hit for 5 seconds.
- Upon reaching 3 stacks, the stacks detonate dealing 150, 250, 350 Physical Damage.
- Staff of the Master effect:
* Upon reaching 3 stacks, also sends 4 projectiles out from the target.
* Each projectile deals 100, 150, 200 Physical Damage and detonates any HEAT Round stacks on the first enemy hero hit.

New Debut Edition Nitro Avatar: Marauder
- Death's Cradle is a valley that slithers between Darkwood Vale and the Rulian Marsh. It is a shadowed land full of man-eating plants and insects, quickmuck, cannibalistic tribes, and the sole location in Newerth where the legendary Hellflower grows.
Marauders of the Scourge Tribe are partially raised by an elder Cradle beast from infancy, and the two companions build an unbreakable bond by drinking one another's blood. This connects them physically, emotionally, and spiritually, and makes them a terrifying enemy that has the ability to flank, surround, and overwhelm while fighting with one mind.

New Nitro Avatar: Danse Macabre
- This reckless Death Prowler danced a little too close to Blackwal and fell into the clutches of Lord Salforis, who saw the potential for a devastating machine of necromancy in the aggressive duo and their war wagon. After agonizing torture, death, and reanimation, Danse Macabre churned through the gates of Blackwal, hungry to begin their grisly dance of death.
- This avatar interacts with the Blackwal avatars.


== General ==

- Nitro's theme music added to Mid Wars and Forests of Caldavar lobbies.
- A new visually improved area cast targeting indicator has been added to some abilities.


== Gameplay Features ==

Personal Courier

+ Each player will now have their own personal courier. This courier will be invulnerable and cannot be controlled outside of delivering items directly between your stash and hero.

+ The courier in its current form focuses on self-satisfaction of delivering your items but comes at the cost of a shared resource: time. Time is invaluable; the difference between getting your bottle 2 minutes earlier, your key item before a big team fight or wards while you have map positioning can mean victory instead of defeat. By introducing a personal courier, we expect players to spend less time fighting amongst teammates for their items and more time participating in the action.

+ Courier models are now selected in the vault, and can no longer be changed in-game.


== Gameplay Changes ==

Wards
+ In addition to removing the tedium of micromanaging the courier, we've also reduced the necessity for additional vision sources to de-ward.
- Wards of Revelation: Upon placement, will additionally grant vision of all enemy Wards of Sight and enemy Wards of Revelation in the area for 12 seconds.
* Enemy wards placed after your Ward of Revelation is placed will not be detected through fog.


Tower Targeting
+ You will no longer be targeted by the tower over lane creeps due to proximity.
- Tower default attack behavior will now prioritize lane creeps over heroes.


Laning
+ The high variance in levels between solo and dual lanes oftentimes forces a Jungler or discourages participation in the lane. The Jungler role is intended to be optional, not mandatory. To encourage more diverse team rosters, we've placed more emphasis on dual lanes by granting more experience exclusive to lane partners.
- Lane creeps now yield 20% additional experience if at least one other allied hero is present.


Pushing & Resources
+ Deconstructing the gameplay, we've noticed that the game has been centralized around denying the enemy the few available resources on the map. This has caused the game to focus very heavily on grouping up early to force constant teamfights. In doing so, a defending team that is behind has very limited opportunities to respond, often resulting in long, delayed base turtling which isn't fun for either side.
To help address this, we are increasing both the pushing potential and resources of creeps much sooner in the game. Pushing with lane creeps will become much more effective while pushing strategies without creeps will become less effective.
- Tower attack damage increased from 110/130/152 to 110/160/210 to tiers 1/2/3 respectively.
- Tier 3 tower armor lowered from 25 to 18.
* Tier 4 towers still have 30 Armor.
- Tower health increased from 1300/1600 to 1500/1900.
- Melee Lane Creeps attack damage multiplier against towers increased from 0.7 to 1.0.
- Ranged Lane Creeps attack damage multiplier against towers increased from 0.35 to 0.7.
- Creep damage and health upgrade interval decreased from 7 minutes to 5 minutes.
- Lane creeps will now gain +5 movement speed every 5 minutes.


== Normal Mode ==

Gold Changes
+ We are taking a directional approach towards focusing on a baseline of individual progression. Similar to the existing bounty mechanics that increase the worth of higher GPM players, we are introducing bounty reductions and reduced gold loss on death targeted at underperforming players.
- Hero bounties can now be reduced by up to 50% based on that hero's GPM versus the game's average GPM.
- Hero bounties proximity gold per level decreased from 7 to 5.
- Hero gold base bounties increased from 200 to 250.
- Gold given for ending kill streaks increased from 25 to 50.
- Gold loss on death can now be reduced by up to 50% based on that hero's GPM versus the game's average GPM.
- Gold loss on death per level decreased from 25 to 20.


Experience Changes
+ The current distribution of experience has two flaws with it:
- It largely favors players who survive on the outskirts of the fight even if they contributed the least.
- It punishes those who are first to engage even if they contributed the most.
+ These flaws create a high level of disparity among teammates and cause players to not be properly rewarded for their contributions. Distributing experience to dead players who have earned valid assists and kills in combat will serve as a level equalizer, lowering the incentive to strictly survive and allow players to still progress in levels even if they're severely behind.
- Players will now split hero kill experience with other players in range, even if they are dead, as long as they contributed to the hero kill.
- Hero EXP base bounty decreased from 90 to 75.
- EXP from hero kills rescaled from 90 per level to 65 + 5 additional increment per level.


Pacing Changes
- 4th Melee Creep now spawns at 11 minutes instead of 15 minutes.
- 2nd Ranged Creep now spawns at 22 minutes instead of 32 minutes.
- 5th Melee Creep now spawns at 33 minutes instead of 43 minutes.



== Casual Mode ==
+ Casual Mode does a great job of ramping up action and resources, however the sudden destruction of the base from one team fight can leave a game feeling incomplete and you dissatisfied. We are toning down some of the rapid power spikes that occur from hero deaths and moving towards a more consistent game pacing.
- Towers' armor reduction while heroes are dead decreased from 20% per hero to 10% per hero.
- Respawn timers have been adjusted slightly to increase the window of opportunity for teams to push after killing an enemy.


Gold Changes
- Hero Gold Bounties decreased from 350 to 300.
- Hero Gold Bounties per level increased from 10 to 12.
- Gold tick increased from 88.88 to 100 GPM.
- Tower team gold decreased from 300,350,400,450 to 250,275,300,300.


Experience Changes
- Hero EXP base bounty decreased from 85 to 65.
- EXP required to level has been increased by about 5-15%. Levels 1-10 will have the most significant increase while levels 20-25 will have the least increase


Pacing Changes
- 4th Melee Creep spawns at 9 minutes instead of 10 minutes.
- 5th Melee Creep spawns at 28 minutes instead of 33 minutes.
- 6th Melee Creep spawns at 41 minutes instead of 50 minutes.
- 2nd Ranged Creep spawns at 18 minutes instead of 32 minutes.


== Hero Balance ==

The following hero has been added to Tournament Rules:
- Parallax

The following heroes have been removed from Tournament Rules:
- Forsaken Archer
- Ravenor
- Vindicator

Arachna
+ Arachna's Precision had too much overlap with Andromeda's Dimensional Link and Moon Queen's Lunar Glow auras. Arachna now gains a bonus percentage increase on Physical Damage when damaging units, based on how much health they are missing. This helps Arachna's lane dominance and mid-game viability, granting her amazing damage output and crippling power against a single target.

Harden Carapace
- Can be activated while Stunned or Silenced when this skill is level 2 or higher.
- Cooldown increased from 22/20/18/16 seconds to 28/28/22/16 seconds.

Precision
- Passively grants True Strike to allies within 900 radius at level 4 of the skill.
- Passively increases Arachna's Attack Damage by up to 40/60/80/100% when damaging a non-building target based on how much Health they are missing.
* Minimum of 10% bonus Attack Damage dealt; maximum of 120 bonus Physical Damage dealt.
* Deals 50% of the bonus damage against non-hero units.
* Attack Damage increase gradient is linear.


Artillery
+ Artillery has been shining a little too brightly since the rework and a cost increase to his LRM will allow for a little more thought when using the ability.

LRM
- Mana cost increased from 10 to 15.


Behemoth
+ A small readjustment from his previous buffs. Although Merrick's Bounty is a key component to his spike in wins, we feel the new numbers on Enrage are more well-rounded.

Enrage
- Bonus damage on next attack decreased from 100/175/275/375% to 100/175/250/325% of your Base Damage.


Calamity
+ Calamity's ultimate was providing too much free initiation for a ranged carry and we had to rein it in a bit. A slight mana cost increase on her Firebomb will make her mana management a little more crucial.

Firebomb
- Mana cost increased from 85/90/95/100 to 80/95/110/125.

Sunder's Vault
- Range decreased from 1500 to 1200.


Chronos
+ Chronos is a hard carry and is meant to be played that way. However, competitors began using Chronos as a suicide initiator and it was causing Chronos to become more of a nuisance than a true carry hero. The changes below are aimed at making Chronos less reliable as a ganker and more reliable as a carry.

Curse of Ages
- Chance now starts at 0% and increases by 5/6/7/8% every time Chronos attacks a non-building unit.
* Skill will not proc immediately after another proc; at least 1 attack must happen before the skill can proc again.
* Automatically procs on 12th attack no matter what.
- Timer for charge loss adjusted from 8/7/6/5 seconds to 7 seconds.
- All charges are now lost when the timer on Curse of Ages expires.
- Procs deal 2x damage to targets affected by Chronofield.


Deadlift
+ Deadlift's design is focused around a very strong early game. He is meant to crush his lane and push down towers, and then fall off hard in the late game. His laning is very frustrating to deal with and his late game is almost non-existent. We are hoping to pull this back a bit and look at him some more for the next balance patch if needed.

Death Grip
- Increased the max channel duration from 2.6 seconds to 4.6 seconds so it can travel further.
* Still requires a channel time of 2 seconds to receive the max immobilize duration.
- Only travels up to a maximum of 1000 units if the channel is canceled.
- You no longer need to activate the ability a second time for it to be able to travel the full 3300 range.

Onslaught
- Cooldown decreased from 25 to 25/23/21/19.
- Attack speed reduced from 50/75/100/125 to 20/50/80/110.

The Dead Shall Rise
- Damage reduced on active from 90/110/130/150 to 75/100/125/150.



Deadwood
+Deadwood has transitioned into an anti-strength hero rather than an anti-everything hero. This change was healthy for diversity; however, the feel and impact Deadwood left in a game went down. To compensate for that loss in feel, we have made the following changes:

Rotten Grasp
- Now does Physical Damage over time instead of Magic Damage over time.
* Cast effect type is still Magic.
- Damage reduced from 150/200/250/300 to 100/150/200/250 Physical Damage.

Willowmaker
- Deals 250/475/725 Physical Damage and 19 x 35% of the target's Strength in bonus Physical Damage.
- Now gives Deadwood 35% of the target's Strength for 7 seconds after hitting them.
- Still applies the Stun and Slow.



Defiler
+ Defiler has lost her way as a massive "teamfight" hero with amazing push capabilities. With these changes we are increasing her push capabilities immensely, making Defiler one of the premiere pushers in Newerth.
- Base Strength increased from 19 to 23.

Unholy Expulsion
- Number of spirits spawned increased from 5/10/16 to 7/12/17.
* Number of bonus spirits from Power in Death remains the same, effectively increasing the number of spirits Defiler has by 2/2/1.
- Staff of the Master Added
* 1500 cast range.
* Activating this ability again while the spirits are active will quickly send them toward the target.
* Targeting enemy units and structures will send the spirits to attack once and then return to Defiler.
** Spirits deal 80% of their regular damage when using this ability.
* Targeting an allied hero will consume all spirits, healing the target for half of their stored damage.
* While Defiler's spirits are alive, the second activation has a 6-second cooldown after being used.


Flint Beastwood
+ Flint has been a staple in HoN since the beginning, but we felt the ability to gank him successfully was too easy to accomplish. The following changes are meant to make him have a more solid interaction with his abilities and offset some of his weaknesses.

Explosive Flare
- Cast range increased from 800 to 900.
- Projectile speed increased from 2000 to 2200.

Hollowpoint Shells
- Now has a 100% chance to proc when attacking out of Dead Eye's fully faded invisibility.

Dead Eye
- Increases day and night vision radius by 50/100/150/200 units.
- While standing still, Flint Beastwood fades into invisibility over 1.5 seconds.

Money Shot
- Mana cost decreased from 175/275/375 to 150/250/350.


Forsaken Archer
+ For a long time now Forsaken Archer has overlapped heroes like Draconis and, to a degree, Klanx. We want Forsaken Archer to be the go-to option for an AoE Magic damage-dealing carry, and boy is she. With this, we realize that Draconis will need a rework as well and that is coming in an upcoming patch!

Crippling Volley
- Cooldown increased from 10 to 18/16/14/12 seconds.
- Forsaken Archer now leaves a Skeletal Minion behind to cast the ability instead of casting it herself, allowing her to cast it without interrupting her other orders.

Split Fire
- Can be toggled on and off on a 1-second cooldown.
- While toggled on:
* Increases damage taken by 15% but grants 10/15/20/25 Attack Speed and splits your attacks into 2/3/4/5, each dealing 50/60/70/80% of damage.
* Main target takes full damage.

Call of the Damned
- You no longer collect or store Skeletal Minions by gaining last hits.
- Now passively grants a 10% chance to spawn an archer any time Forsaken Archer or any of her units deal non-dot damage.
- The archer will attack 1 time dealing 10/20/30/40% of your attack damage in magic damage and disappear.
* Archers can spawn more archers themselves, provided the chance procs. They deal 10/20/30/40% of Forsaken Archer's Damage.
- In addition, this effect is guaranteed to trigger on Forsaken Archer's attack whenever the ability is off cooldown (with a 5-second cooldown).
* This also allows for 2 Skeletal Minions to spawn at the same time due to a proc.


Glacius
+ A new Staff of the Master to really help bring his ultimate into a masterful lockdown tool.

Glacial Downpour
- Staff of the Master changes:
* When activated you apply your current level of Ice Imprisonment to yourself.
* Enemies who are hit by three shards of ice from this ability have your current level of Ice Imprisonment applied to them.
* Staff of the Master no longer increases the damage dealt by this ability.


Gladiator
+ Gladiator's Call to Arms was available for too much of the game and was providing the 50% temporary damage reduction to allies for too long during teamfights. Therefore, these parameters got readjusted to more reasonable values.

Call to Arms
- Cooldown increased from 70/60/50 seconds to 80/70/60 seconds.
- Damage reduction duration reduced from 10 seconds to 5/6/7 seconds.


Gunblade
+ Some solid buffs to help Gunblade during his solo harass and changes aimed at making him more gank-focused. Lethal Range will increase his farm but at a cost of placing himself in questionable positions.

Lethal Range
- Attacking a non-hero unit within 200 units of you grants 50% of the bonus damage you'd get against a hero.

Grappling Shot
- Cooldown decreased from 90/75/60 seconds to 70/50/30 seconds.


Klanx
+ Klanx has had one defining problem: he has too much of an early game focus with such a hard carry kit. These changes are aimed at reducing his early game farm and his ability to escape that allowed him to snowball a bit too quickly.
- Agility gain per level decreased from 3.0 to 2.8.

H.A.W.K.
- Mana cost increased from 65 to 75.
- State duration reduction when being attacked increased from 2.5 seconds per attack to 4 seconds per attack.

Goon Squad
- The first minion (the one with Chain Lightning) and the second minion (the one with the Movement Speed Slow application) are switched.


Lord Salforis
+ A hero that has always filled an extremely cool niche in the game but has never been fully explored by competitors and the public playerbase. These changes are intended to give Salforis a solid contribution to any lineup even if they are not centered around "anti-healing."
- Base Damage increased from 47-57 to 53-57.
- Magic Armor increased from 5 to 6.
- Strength gain per level increased from 2.4 to 2.6.

Mors Certissima
- Radius increased from 225 to 250.

Dark Lord's Presence
- Health Regeneration reduction on enemies and Health Regeneration steal changed from 50% to 30/45/60/75%.
- Minimum True Damage per second increased from 10 to 15.

The Undying
- Staff of the Master
* In addition to the soul mechanic you gain a bonus 20 Health Regeneration as well as a bonus 3 Health Regeneration per 100 HP of missing life while The Undying is active on a target.
* Still keeps the soul gain on-kill benefit if someone dies while under the influence of the ultimate.


Magebane
+ Magebane now has slightly increased effectiveness against casters without changing his core playstyle.
- Magic Armor increased from 5.5 to 7.

Mana Combustion
- Mana Combustion amount changed from 16/32/48/64 to 6/14/22/30 + 3/4/5/6% of the target's Max Mana.

Mana Rift
- Radius increased from 325 to 375.


Moira
+ Moira was providing too much frustration because of her immense utility alongside the safety of her Ephemeral Forge mimic. More counterplay was introduced for Mana Sunder and the overall effectiveness of Shards of Harkon was reduced slightly at all levels.

Shards of Harkon
- Stun duration decreased from 2 seconds to 1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds.
* The duration was bugged to be 2 seconds at all levels; this is simply readjusting them to their intended numbers.
- Magic Damage reduced from 70/140/210/280 to 70/120/170/220.

Mana Sunder
- Is now purgeable (target regains their suppressed mana when the state is purged).


Moon Queen
+ The need to diversify our hero pool continues with this change, making her passive different from those of Arachna and Andromeda. At the same time this will increase her ability to target enemies with Moon Beam and Moon Finale during nighttime.

Lunar Glow
- In addition to its current benefits, Moon Queen's night vision radius is increased by 200/400/600/800 units.


Moraxus
+ The buff to Moraxus was overshot slightly and with the Staff of the Master coming we decided to tone down the previous buff to compensate.

Arcane Shield
- Bonus Attack Damage reduced from 60/80/100/120 to 40/60/80/100.

Matraxe
- Staff of the Master
* While Moraxus' ultimate is active, all damage he deals from all sources will shoot an axe toward the enemy.


Myrmidon
+ A readjustment from the buffs of the first balance patch to squeeze Myrmidon right where he needs to be.

Forced Evolution
- Magic Armor reduced from 5/10/15 to 4/7/10.


Pandamonium
+ Pandamonium received some quality of life tweaks with all his spells. In particular, Face Smash comes out much quicker to reduce the chances of a target slipping away from a surprise gank or blink with Portal Key, while Flick's ridiculously high cooldown has been toned down to be available more often.
- Base Intelligence increased from 15 to 17.

Flick
- Cooldown reduced from 24/22/20/18 seconds to 16/15/14/13 seconds.
- Mana cost reduced from 85 to 65.

Cannon Ball
- Mana cost rescaled from 100 to 85/90/95/100.

Face Smash
- Cast action time reduced from 500ms to 350ms.
- Mana cost reduced from 100/175/250 to 100/150/200.


Parallax
+ A hard carry like Parallax was peaking too high in the laning phase of the game due to the sheer strength of his Fulcrum Shift ability. We toned this down slightly and adjusted his ultimate, while adding a new Staff of the Master to keep one of our newer faces in Newerth up to date!

Fulcrum Shift
- Bonus Magic Damage decreased from 10% max mana + 0/65/85/85/105 to 8% max mana + 0/60/80/80/100.

Earthshatter
- Amount of excess max mana required for a 4 Damage/second increase against an enemy hero increased from 100 max mana to 125 max mana.
- A bug was fixed where Parallax was doing 20 damage per second less than intended after obtaining more mana than an enemy hero.
- Staff of the Master added:
* Causes this ability to deal Superior Magic damage and halves the cooldown at each level.


Pearl
+ Pearl lacked offensive presence in the laning phase and failed to peel people properly. With these changes, Pearl's Asphyxiate has more of an area of effect purge focus, rather than focusing on its single-target damage. Its damage and slow have been rescaled appropriately to be much more intimidating at level 1. Preservation plays a better role in peeling people away from Pearl's team with a slight stun airtime increase.

Asphyxiate
- Targetable on allies (purges debuffs, retains the second AoE burst effect against enemies).
- Second burst radius increased from 300 to 400.
- Second burst Magic Damage increased from 35/70/105/140 to 80/120/160/200.
- Initial burst Magic Damage reduced from 35/70/105/140 to 30.
* Total damage to a single target changed from 70/140/210/280 to 110/150/190/230.
- Second burst Movement Speed slow duration increased from 0.6 seconds to 0.6/0.9/1.2/1.5 seconds.
- Delay for second burst to occur reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5 seconds.

Preservation
- Stun airtime increased from 1 second to 1.2 seconds.
- Cast effect type changed from Magic to Superior Magic.
* Push effect bypasses Magic Immunity.
- Push distance properly adjusted to 600 units away from the center of the bubble.
* Units were pushed back slightly less than intended if the target was closer to the edge of the bubble.
- Cooldown reduced from 120/100/80 seconds to 100/85/70 seconds.


Pestilence
+ Still a solid initiator that has simply lost a bit of its niche in the competitive scene. A slight increase in stun duration and damage will help Pestilence stay a relevant pick in the current meta.

Impale
- Physical Damage increased from 50/100/150/200 to 75/125/175/225.
- Stun duration increased from 1/1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds to 1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds.


Prophet
+ Prophet has suffered from a lack of a role or "Role Confusion" since his inception. The hero was not the best ganker, support, or semi-carry. These changes are aimed at making him less level-dependent and more of a hard support.

Invigorate
- Bonus Attack Speed increased from 50/100/150/200 to 100/200/200/200.
- Number of attacks with the bonus Attack Speed rescaled from 2 attacks to 2/2/3/4 attacks.

Persecution
- Magic Damage readjusted from 35/40/45/50 to 25/35/45/55.
* Initial hit deals 50 Magic Damage.
- Max number of attacks that proc the ministun increased from 1/2/3/4 attacks to 2/3/4/5 attacks.

Shared Fate
- The 50% Movement Speed Slow is no longer a tapering slow; it is always a 50% Movement Speed Slow now.
- Cast range increased from 600 to 700.
- Cast radius increased from 450 to 600.
- Charge system removed from the skill.
- Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 100/80/60 seconds.
- Mana cost increased from 75 to 100/150/200.
- Duration readjusted from 7 seconds to 5/7/9 seconds.


Ravenor
+ The original design for Ravenor was to get into a fight and deal more damage the longer he is in the fight. He was not intended to farm right before a teamfight and melt a target with max charges on his Power Overwhelming skill before they could react. Additionally, Ravenor's Power Overwhelming is the main problem due to a high power variance between 0 charges & maximum charges.

+ To better control this and prevent certain items from giving Ravenor a huge power spike, the proc mechanics of Power Overwhelming were changed to be gained only when damaging enemy heroes with Ravenor's auto attacks or his abilities.

+ To partially compensate for the loss of farm speed from the auto attacks on Power Overwhelming, Electrical Feedback was changed to deal more damage against non-hero units. It was also reworked to fit Ravenor's style of play by triggering on his auto attacks rather than ultimately acting as a "filler skill" and relying on enemies to attack him. It also gives Ravenor another reliable method of obtaining charges on Power Overwhelming due to the design changes on that skill.

Electrical Feedback
- Passively shocks the target and 2 enemy units within 400 radius every 2 auto attacks, dealing 10/20/30/40 Magic Damage.
- Prioritizes enemy heroes.
- Deals 300% more damage against non-hero units (40/80/120/160 Magic Damage).
- Activate to gain 15/30/45/60 Attack Speed for 6 seconds.
- Mana cost: 40/50/60/70.
- Cooldown: 12 seconds.

Power Overwhelming
- Charges are now only gained when ability damage and auto attack damage is dealt against enemy heroes.
- Charge gain per instance of ability damage and auto attack damage increased from 4 to 7.
- Max charges increased from 100 to 125.
- Bonus Movement Speed per charge decreased from 0.75/1/1.25 to 0.6/0.8/1.
- Bonus Damage per charge decreased from 1/1.5/2 to 0.8/1.2/1.6.
* Same maximum potential bonus Movement Speed and bonus Damage.
- A minimum of 25 charges is obtained on Ravenor when he deals ability damage or auto attack damage against an enemy hero.


Riftwalker
+ An overall buff to Riftwalker's laning presence to make her a more viable support pick-up amongst her competitors.

Rift Burn
- Radius increased from 150 to 200 for the initial Magic Damage burst.
- Radius increased from 300 to 400 for the continuous Magic Damage pulses.
- Magic Damage pulse interval decreased from 1 second to 0.75 seconds.
- Now lasts 4.5 seconds, down from 6.
* Total damage output remains the same.


Riptide
+ We are honing in on where Riptide should be playing with her water mechanic and these changes are to facilitate these adjustments.

Undertow
- Puddle duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.
- Slow duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.

In My Element
- Cooldown reduced from 45 to 20 seconds.

Eye of the Storm
- Now twice as easy to control.
- Touch radius against heroes for the explosion reduced from 200 to 150.
- Cooldown increased from 80 to 100/90/80 seconds.


Scout
+ Some minor quality of life changes for a hero that is underperforming. The focus on Vanish should help players roam more efficiently and gain better positioning in team fights.

Vanish
- Cooldown reduced from 15/12/9/6 seconds to 12/10/8/6 seconds.
- Movement Speed bonus increased from 10/12/14/16% to 10/15/20/25%.


Silhouette
+ A small tweak to her ultimate to allow players ganking Silhouette to have a small window in which they can attack before she swaps.

Shadow
- Like a Ninja's (swap sub-ability) cast action time increased from 0ms to 150ms.


Succubus
+ Succubus is the single-target debilitator hero, and is also the iconic hero for winning 1v1 mid lanes the vast majority of the time. Though she has this niche, she has always failed to consistently capitalize on her lead because her ultimate is not available to her for a large part of the early game. These changes are aimed at allowing her to capitalize on her laning phase advantage.

Smitten
- Cast action time reduced from 500ms to 300ms.
- Target's damage output reduction adjusted from 40% to 26/34/42/50%.
- Duration increased from 4/8/12/16 seconds to 10/12/14/16 seconds.

Mesmerize
- Succubus can cancel Mesmerize on herself at any time.
- Cooldown decreased from 15 seconds to 15/14/13/12 seconds.
- Cast range increased from 500/550/600/650 to 500/575/650/725.
- Cast action time decreased from 500ms to 400ms.

Cursed Embrace
- Cooldown decreased from 120/100/80 seconds to 100/85/70 seconds.


Tundra
+ A hero that fills a unique niche in our game of map control has been outdone by the recent addition of Veiled Rot. We decided rather than having Veiled Rot counter Tundra, Tundra should counter it.
- Magic Armor decreased from 5.5 to 4.5.

Call of Winter
- Shiver
* Shiver's day & night vision increased from 800/800/1200/1200 units to 800/1000/1200/1400 units.
* Shiver now reveals units that have the Veiled Rot stealth state within 800/1000/1200/1400 of Shiver.
** Does not dispel the Veiled Rot stealth state.
- Coeurl
* Coeurl's Attack Damage rescaled from 0/26/26/46 to 0/26/36/46.
* Coeurl's Max Health rescaled from 0/400/400/500 to 0/400/450/500.
* Coeurl's Attack Speed Slow on Winter's Bite increased from 0/20/20/35 to 0/20/30/40.
* Coeurl's Movement Speed Slow on Winter's Bite increased from 0/20/20/35% to 0/20/30/40%.

Cold Shoulder
- Attack Speed bonus increased from 15/30/40/60 to 20/40/60/80.


Vindicator
+ Vindicator always had the problem of being either no fun to play, too frustrating to play against, or both. He failed at his intended role as a carry and also failed at his spellcast interruption niche due to being reliant on his enemy's spellcast actions. The rework solves these problems by giving him an arsenal of soft crowd control (CC) skills and giving him a much more active role. He also has much more potential to carry the team through his disruption kit, as well as some more late-game scaling with buffs to Master's Incantation.
- Base Strength reduced from 20 to 17.
- New voice lines.

Sage's Lore
+ Brain Drain was replaced and had its name changed back to Sage's Lore; the skill is already better when comparing the difference in the skill names alone.
- Target a position to deal 85/140/195/250 Magic Damage to all enemies within the area and Disarm player-controlled enemy units for 0.7/1/1.3/1.6 seconds.
* Effect type: Magic
* Range: 700
* Radius: 300
* Mana Cost: 80/100/120/140
* Cooldown: 14/12/10/8 seconds
* Cast action time of 300ms

Master's Incantation
- Mana cost reduced from 15 to 10.
- No longer has a cooldown.
- No longer considered an Attack Modifier.
* For clarification, you can still manually cast the skill to "orbwalk" and not draw creep aggro. The only thing that changed is that the skill can stack with other Attack Modifiers.
- Bonus True Damage is multiplied by 1.5 against silenced targets.
- Bonus True Damage rescaled from 0/15/30/45/60% of Vindicator's Intelligence to 0/22/33/44/55% of Vindicator's Intelligence.
- Passive: Vindicator now gains +1 Intelligence permanently when he kills an enemy hero, or if an enemy hero dies within 925 radius.
* Enemies do not lose any Intelligence when they die.
* Skill is automatically leveled at level 1, making this a 5-point skill. Active is disabled when the skill is at level 1.

Glyph of Silence
- Target a position to summon an immobile Totem that lasts for 5 seconds. The Totem will be destroyed when it receives 2 auto attacks.
- Enemy units within 1000 radius of the Totem receive a Movement Speed Slow up to 30/34/38/42% the closer the target is to the Totem (minimum of 0/4/8/12% Movement Speed Slow). The Movement Speed Slow lingers for 1 second after leaving the radius, after the Totem expires, or is destroyed.
- Enemy units within 300 radius of the Totem are also Silenced for 1.3/1.7/2.1/2.5 seconds upon entering this inner radius. Enemies already affected by this Silence will not be silenced if they re-enter this 300 radius within the same cast instance of Glyph of Silence.
- Grants 25 gold when killed by an enemy.
* Effect type: Magic
* Range: 700
* Mana Cost: 90/105/120/135
* Cooldown: 17 seconds
* Cast action time of 150ms

Final Chapter
- Cooldown decreased from 160 seconds to 110 seconds.
- Global Silence duration decreased from 3/4/5 seconds to (0.1 x charges) seconds.
* Final Chapter gains 20/25/30 charges when coming off cooldown and gains 1 charge every 4.5 seconds.
* Maximum of 30/40/50 charges.
* Total time to reach maximum effectiveness (max charges) from after the skill is used is 145/167.5/200 seconds (adjusted from a static cooldown of 160 seconds).
- Final Chapter also globally applies a 40% Movement Speed Slow to all enemy heroes for 1 second.
- Mana cost decreased from 200/250/300 to 175/225/275.
- Cast action time decreased from 300ms to 200ms.
- When cast, the sound for the enemy team will be muted for the duration of ability. However, Taunts and certain other important sounds are still audible for gameplay reasons.


War Beast
+ The reward for Battle Cry was too high and allowed heroes to win their lanes too easily. This change will make the spamming of this ability more of a choice and lower the uptime during the laning phase.

Battle Cry
- Mana cost increased from 25/20/15/10 to 30 at all levels.


Wildsoul 
+ While Wildsoul's kit is more attuned to the game of Heroes of Newerth, he is still having trouble competing with other heroes of his like. With 12 inventory slots as his unique niche in the game, we want to help facilitate that by increasing his farm capabilities.

Summon Booboo
- Alpha Male Damage to creeps increased from 25% to 50% and bonus damage at level 4 increased from 25 to 50% (total 100%).


Wretched Hag
+ A quality of life change since Sonar Scream's radius does not significantly improve as the skill is leveled up.

Sonar Scream
- Radius increased from 425/450/475/500 to 500 at all levels.


Zephyr
+ Zephyr has fallen off due to the lack of a meta that needs him. However, his presence in HoN is still quite underwhelming. These changes are aimed at allowing Zephyr to start off in the jungle and to get more consistent damage out of his cyclones.

Gust
- Increased cast range from 700 to 800.

Cyclones
- Increased the damage AoE of each cyclone from 150 to 300.
- Lifetime of a cyclone decreased from 60 to 40 seconds.
- You will now passively gain a cyclone every 20 seconds.
* This allows you to get about 2 cyclones early game to get a nice start in the jungle.
- When cyclones expire they now heal for the same amount as if you used them manually.
- Heal decreased from 25 to 20.
- Damage decreased from 15/20/25/30 to 6/9/12/15.
* The increased AoE for cyclone's damage is a huge buff so these changes are to compensate a bit for that.
- Cyclones no longer deal 25% less damage to creeps and neutrals.

Typhoon
- Cyclones will now spawn even if Zephyr is not inside the Typhoon.


== Items ==


Genjuro
+ A fix to match the previous Assassin Shroud change.
- Stealth duration increased from 9 seconds to 11 seconds.
- Charge refresh time increased from 14 seconds to 16 seconds.
* Matches Assassin's Shroud duration and cooldown increases from Patch 3.6.0.


Merrick's Bounty
+ Merrick's Bounty is doing a lot of good things for supports right now but the amount of gold returned is about 5% too much. We toned it down a bit to reflect that.
- Cooldown decreased from 30 to 20 seconds.
- Gold per charge decreased from 10 to 9.


Runed Cleaver
+ Small quality of life change.
- Tree chop cooldown is no longer shared with Logger's Hatchet.


Thunderclaw & Charged Hammer
+ While we reevaluate the item pool in general, we found it necessary to increase the cost of Thunderclaw to reduce its effectiveness on early game farming.
- Thunderclaw recipe cost increased by 200 gold.
- Charged Hammer recipe cost decreased by 200 gold (total price remains the same as before).


Jungle Changes
+ The following changes are meant to alleviate some of the tediousness in the jungle in general.
- Corpses no longer block camps from spawning.
- Antlore Necromancers no longer spawn Zomblings when unowned by a player.
* Can still toggle the ability on when a player controls an Antlore Necromancer.
- Wild Hunter Camp no longer has both stealth and magic immunity.
* One Wild Hunter now has stealth, and the other has magic immunity.

= Paragons =

The Paragons are a faction of ancient, elemental guardians from the isolated Isle of Argentia. They embody the wisdom, emotion, and power of the earth, and the flesh of each Paragon has been overtaken by veins of crystals that hold a strong connection to the planet. They have refused to enter the wars among Man, Beast, and Daemon for fear that if captured, their bodies could be used as conduits to feed death and corruption directly into the earth.
But with King Jeraziah driven to the brink of his faith and needing someone to counter the self-righteous destruction of the URSA Corps, he summons The Paragons, knowing that once they see the state of Newerth they will be forced to join the fight against the Hellbourne as well.

New Paragon Rhapsody Avatar: Tourmaline Paragon Rhapsody
- The youngest of the Paragons, Tourmaline is focused on eliminating anger, fear, and jealousy from the world while remaining calm and tranquil herself. Some may call her naive for setting such a lofty goal, but all who stand near her in battle can attest to the overwhelming feelings of tranquility and peace, even in moments of unbelievable pressure. However, if they are being completely honest, they will also divulge the hints of jealousy toward her flawless hair and effortless musicality. And so Tourmaline's journey continues...

Tourmaline Paragon Rhapsody Upgrades:
- Staccato Upgrade: Adds a sound wave beam, sound waves circling the source and target, and pink crystal shards exploding off of the target.
- Disco Inferno Upgrade: Adds pulsing circles growing from the center to the edges, sound waves encircling the boundary, brighter crystals and crystal notes, and crystal notes of the appropriate colors encircling units for enemy and ally states (red and green).
- Arcane Hymn Upgrade: Adds sound pulses and lights circling the feet of the character.
- Protective Melody Upgrade: Adds spiraling crystals emitting from her and sound waves on the staff lines encircling her.
- Carnage Counter Upgrade: Dazzle all of Newerth with a running display of your all-time kills and assists with your Paragon avatars!

= The War Effort =

New War Effort Pestilence Avatar: Carrion Beetle
- It began with The First Corruption, when the swarms of Great Waste Carrion Beetles originally tasted dead daemon flesh. The undying corruption within the meat took root in the carcass eaters and began to change them, speeding their evolution into massive and terrifyingly efficient scavengers. When The Second Corruption shattered Newerth, the fully daemonic Carrion Beetles not only feasted upon the mountains of man, beast, and daemon corpses -- they also discovered a taste for living flesh, even though it quickly ceased to be such.

= General =

New Gladiator Avatar: Vanquish
- Although the fringe societies along the Seradati Plains claimed to adhere to Legion law under Maliken Grimm, their traditions of slavery and human fighting pits endured long after their banners flew beneath his. Grimm allowed this, for it served as a vetting process for the elite combatants in his vanguard, but when Prince Jeraziah took the throne he ordered the pits closed and the slaves freed. The slavemasters would not sleep well knowing such dangerous and vengeful men lived and plotted among them, and so ordered the execution of every gladiator and slave. "The King wants them freed," they joked, "what is more free than death?"
But the gladiators made it their life's work to not die easily, and when the executioners came they faced an army of professional killers led by the most veteran among them, the one called Vanquish, who earned his sobriquet time and again as he sacked city after city, leaving a trail of dead slavemasters in his wake.

New Prisoner Avatar: Rune Breaker
- The Rune Weavers have tried to reclaim all of their precious Portal Keys from the Hellbourne, but the daemons instantly recognized the power within the teleportation devices and now guard them with brutal greediness. This has forced the Rune Weavers to reluctantly unleash the Rune Breaker, a titan from the furthest valleys of the Iron Mountains whose sole purpose is to seek the magic wrought by the Weavers, crush those who wield it and claim it for himself.

New Succubus Avatar: Headmistress
- School's in, you simpletons! The Headmistress is here to make sure you keep your faces buried in the books -- literally, if necessary -- and don't bother trying to sneak any private messages or cheat codes past her. If she catches you (and she will), she'll drag you into her private detention faster than you can claim you were only smitten and mesmerized by her stunning outfit.

New Vindicator Avatar: Necronomicon Vindicator
- Very few who attempt to join the reclusive order of hermits known as the Vindicators actually succeed -- indeed, there is only one known in all of Newerth -- and many slip into the dark, cobwebbed corners of sorcery to be lost forever. Such is the case with Alhazred the Conjurer, who became obsessed with the legendary Necronomicon, a tome that catalogs and classifies every dead soul in existence. When he came across his own name among the endless pages, the sorcerer went mad and demanded the book tell him how to return to the realm of the living. The words appeared below his name, written in blood: "Born in the cradle of death, it blooms as life wilts." And so Alhazred began his eternal search for the Hellflower, and redemption.

New Gold Collection Amun-Ra Avatar: Karnak the Tomb Guardian
- The fortune hunters of The War Effort have been exploring areas of Newerth untouched for centuries, and when one expedition descended into the pitch-black tombs hidden beneath the Great Waste they found something waiting for them. Karnak the Tomb Guardian had stood watch over his dead master as generations lived and died in the world above, and his mission is simple: prevent anyone from stealing the riches that would ensure his master's prosperity in the afterlife. Good luck to the explorers who try to make him fail.

New Paragon Riftwalker Avatar: Opal Paragon Riftwalker
- The multicolored opal contains traces of the virtues of all the other magical crystals, and the master of these gems wields a powerful spectrum of sorcery. She is able to alter the very fabric of existence, and those affected by her opaline magic find their existence -- what little remains -- completely within her control.

- Even the earth-shakers and wall-breakers need a day off, so the Behemoth Union has it in their contract that a few times a year they get a long weekend away from rebuilding the walls, towers, and barracks destroyed by the Hellbourne. The foremen Engineers actually appreciate this downtime on the job site -- they keep telling the Behemoths that iron girders aren't supposed to be used as hammers and fissures aren't up to code when it comes to running drain systems -- and the holiday allows the Engineers to repair most of the damage done by their work crews. But come Tuesday, it's back to the grind...

New China Dampeer Avatar: Bloodthirsty Dampeer
- The acolytes of Dampeer are known as the Bloodthirsty, men and women who forsake the sustenance of food and drink for the unnatural consumption of human flesh in the hopes it will act as a gateway to their ultimate goal: subsisting on the pure vitality of their victims. They learn quickly that adrenaline and fear make the meat taste far better, so terrorizing their prey before digging in is a must, and a pleasure.
 
New China Draconis Avatar: Gryphon Draconis
- Dragons and Gryphons have always had a tenuous relationship -- each species believes it is the the most majestic and capable guardian of treasure and sacred locations (and the Gryphons insist their flames burn much hotter and cleaner) -- but when it comes to the World Tree, the most priceless and vital life form on Newerth, the Gryphons set aside their rivalry and stand wing-to-wing with Draconis and his kin to ensure the forces of corruption do not touch even a single leaf. But everyone still knows that beaks and feathers are much more glorious than snouts and scales.

New Gold Collection Nomad Avatar: Hang Jebat
- When Hang Jebat learned the Nine Kings of the Great Waste had killed his brother-in-battle Hang Tuah, Hang Jebat took up his fallen friend's sword, the Taming Sari Keris, and went on a legendary rampage. But the rumors of Hang Tuah's death were false, and fearing for their lives the Nine Kings ordered Hang Tuah to kill Hang Jebat and end his murderous spree. These two illustrious warriors have been in eternal combat ever since, and any time they meet on the battlefield the blood and blades fly.

= The War Effort =

New War Effort Fayde Avatar: Red Mist
- It is rare indeed when the living shadow known as Fayde allows her emotions to rise from the darkness within, but when her raw fury finally boils to the surface she discards her black auras and envelops herself in a shroud of her victims' blood, a churning red mist that hides her culling blade and wicked smile until the last moment -- but by then her red mist has already claimed another life.

= The Hotshot Heroes =
+ Heroes of Newerth? More like Heroes of Whowerth! All you self-proclaimed "heroes" need to step aside, because the true guardians of mankind have arrived: The Hotshot Heroes!
 
New Hotshot Heroes Gauntlet Avatar: Mr. Marvelous
- Mr. Marvelous is the self-appointed leader of The Hotshot Heroes, and though he might occasionally grapple with the other egos in the squad as they battle the forces of evil, his over-the-top personality and constant bravado soothe the public into believing they are safe as long as their lives are within the protection of his massive fist.

New Hotshot Heroes Pebbles Avatar: Rocky
- Rocky is the solid foundation of The Hotshot Heroes, an even-tempered, contemplative advocate of talking things through with his team's adversaries, who he refuses to call "villains." They might just be misunderstood, frustrated people with good intentions. But if they pose a legitimate threat to the innocent masses or his fellow Hotshots, Rocky will not hesitate to chuck them into orbit until they calm down a bit.

New Hotshot Heroes Pyromancer Avatar: Blaze
- Blaze epitomizes the Hotshot Heroes name (and should probably be the team leader) with his brash confidence and derring-do approach to stopping villainous troublemakers, a method that usually ends up with at least one structure on fire and a path of scorched earth in his wake. Whatever man, nobody died...right?

New Hotshot Heroes Scout Avatar: The Vanishing Woman
- The Vanishing Woman is an expert at showing up in the right place at the right time -- seemingly out of nowhere -- to help her fellow Hotshots thwart the nefarious plans of evildoers. She doesn't crave the spotlight (but secretly knows it belongs on her), and as she's not one to show off (too much), she prefers to swoop in for an attack, flash a disarming smile to the masses, and vanish once again.

New Gold Collection Calamity Avatar: Carnage Calamity
Only one person in Newerth could venture into the depths of the Scar, slap the daemons around and turn them into her weapons of mass corruption: Carnage Calamity. With a shackled daemon spitting hellfire and a flying ring of burning skull chainsaws, she has stormed out of the Vault of All Hells to kill anything that is or could possibly become a daemon. So everything. She's basically a walking BFG. That stands for Badass Fiery Girl, of course.

= Upgrade Avatar =

New Upgrade Avatar: Sterling Midas
Young Midas was born an orphaned slave who was bought by one of the richest households in the Capital of Arasunia. His unquenchable desire for precious metals and fine jewels began the instant he first saw the finery within the small palace, and he knew the fastest route to wealth would be to gain glory in the illegal gladiatorial arenas of Arasunia. When he was barely in his teens he wore leather and rope into his first contest. Within a year, he was sheathed in bronze. By the time he turned twenty, his skill and popularity had earned him a suit of armor made of sterling silver, and by then his forays into the underworld already had him dabbling in the alchemy which would lead to his ultimate dream...and curse.

Sterling Midas Upgrades
- After purchasing Sterling Midas, his effects and model can be upgraded by purchasing Sterling Midas Upgrades with silver coins in Merrick's Shop.

- The only way to get this rare, auspicious avatar is to be ranked among The War Effort's top 50 at the end of each 28-day cycle, so keep checking that leaderboard and completing those quests! Even the staff can't get the Trophy avatars!

= The Paragons =
The Paragons are a faction of ancient, elemental guardians from the isolated Isle of Argentia. They embody the wisdom, emotion, and power of the earth, and the flesh of each Paragon has been overtaken by veins of crystals that hold a strong connection to the planet. They have refused to enter the wars among Man, Beast, and Daemon for fear that if captured, their bodies could be used as conduits to feed death and corruption directly into the earth.
 
But with King Jeraziah driven to the brink of his faith and needing someone to counter the self-righteous destruction of the URSA Corps, he summons The Paragons, knowing that once they see the state of Newerth they will be forced to join the fight against the Hellbourne as well.

New Paragon Parasite Avatar: Amethyst Paragon Parasite
- A peaceful, serene world free of ailment is ideal for the Amethyst Paragon, whose crystals hold the power to relieve many physical maladies of mortal creatures. He is more than willing to deliver these crystal cures to any who require them, though sometimes the only solution is sending the subject into the next realm of existence, where they will finally find the peace so cherished by the Amethyst crystals.

Amethyst Paragon Parasite Upgrades:
- Leech Upgrade: Purple spores and crystals added to the ability effect.

= Indonesian Independence Day =

New Holiday Edition Indonesian Independence Day Artillery Avatar: Srikandi
- The proud and vengeful princess Amba was reborn as Srikandi, who was raised by her father as a son and trained in the ways of warfare. Srikandi's fierce independence and skill with bow and arrow made her a devastating enemy, especially to those foolish enough to lower their weapons out of concern over fighting a woman.

New Holiday Edition Indonesian Independence Day Accursed Avatar: Rahwana
- After performing severe penance for ten thousand years, Rahwana, the King of Kings and Emperor of the Three Worlds, was gifted by Brahma with the gift of immortality against gods, daemons, and spirits. He used this gift to dominate and oppress the gods, earning the wrath of Vishnu, who knew Rahwana the daemon king could only be killed by a human. With this knowledge, Vishnu chose to be born into mortality as Rama.

When Rahwana learned of this incredible warrior named Rama, he kidnapped the man's one true love, Sita, and tried to force her to marry him. When Rama finally tracked Rahwana down, an epic battle ensued that ended with Rahwana slain and Rama reunited with Sita.

Rahwana was sent into the Vault of All Hells, where he has waited for his chance to be reborn and exact vengeance upon Rama and Sita. The Third Corruption has finally given him that chance, and all of Newerth shudders at his rebirth!

New Holiday Edition Indonesian Independence Day Puppet Master Avatar: Dalang
- Dalang is the sinister master of shadows, twisting them into terrifying and hideous puppets that distract his victims from the fact that he is collecting their shadows as well -- and through it their souls. His prey doesn't realize they've been harvested and added to his collection until they find themselves locked within his kotak, or puppet chest, a helpless shadow puppet forced to do his bidding for eternity.

= Thai Mother's Day =

New Holiday Edition Thai Mother's Day Ellonia Avatar: Floral Ellonia
- Thailand celebrates Mother's Day on the birthday of Her Majesty, Queen Sirikit of Thailand, Mother of all Thai people, who was born on August 12th, 1932. Floral Ellonia is here to honor her and mothers everywhere, and there is going to be a frigid field of trouble coming your way if you don't go hug your mom and tell her thank you.

= China Avatar =

New China Berzerker Avatar: Erik the Red
- The Savages were the last Clan of Men to fall beneath King Maliken Grimm's fist during the War of the Single Banner, and the Berzerkers were the last Savage tribe to bend the knee. They stood in the bitter cold of the Frost Fields, each of them ready to die before relinquishing their beloved freedom, and even the ruthless Grimm knew the bloody cost of exterminating the fanatical warriors would be too high. He named them Wardens of the Frost Fields and left them on the far side of Grimm's Crossing to kill each other or die of exposure.

The Legion heard nothing more from them until the Second Corruption, when a wave of rabid, cold-hardened Berzerkers led by Erik the Red flooded the battlefields in search of carnage and daemon blood. Now the Legion soldiers pray that a Berserker will be among their ranks when the battle begins, for at the very least the howling barbarian will attract the enemy's full attention.

New Paragon Empath Avatar: Emerald Paragon Empath

= The War Effort =

New War Effort Reward Avatar: Forsaken Death Prowler
- The Death Prowlers come in many forms and species, but they are always a pair of terrifying enemies who employ demoralizing hit-and-run tactics to bleed their prey out. The Forsaken Prowler is no exception, using her pinpoint accuracy at any range and speed to ensure the death's head visage of her mount is the last thing her enemies see, if they see it at all.

New Sunburn Bay Ward: Beach Ball Ward 
- Keep an eye out for beach party crashers with this custom ward! 

= Sunburn Bay =

Every year, the Inner Sea's Sunburn Bay is flooded with vacationers looking for sun, fun, and respite from the cold, bloody steel and stone of the war between the Legion and Hellbourne. The hot sand and cool waves are neutral territory, where you might find Legionnaire rubbing suntan oil on all eight of Arachna's legs. Once they leave the beach it's back to death and despair, so everyone enjoy the rest and relaxation while it lasts!

New Sunburn Bay Tarot Avatar: Beach Volleyball Tarot
- Tarot swears she isn't using her abilities when she plays beach volleyball on vacation at Sunburn Bay, but it is a bit suspicious when it seems like she knows where every serve is headed and her spikes ricochet between the other team members, who sometimes get bound together by a spontaneously materializing volleyball net. Who knows, maybe she's just lucky?

New Sunburn Bay Kane Avatar: Lifeguard Kane
- Kane is usually obsessed with ending lives, but when he's on vacation he's all about water safety and proper SPF application. (This is absolutely because he wants to be the one doing the killingâ€”why should the sea and sun have all the fun?) So if you find yourself getting waylaid out of the surf or called out for some one-on-one safety instructions, just go with it and be glad he doesn't give you CPR. Bad breath doesn't take a vacation.

New Sunburn Bay Sand Wraith Avatar: Surf Wraith
- The only thing worse than being a murderous spectre of the Great Waste is fighting hand-to-hand with sand in your shorts. This is one of the many reasons the Sand Wraiths love their time at Sunburn Bay, where they can shed their heavy black robes, forget the curse of the desert for a while and hang ten -- or whatever they have for toes -- and wash the grit out of their groins.

New Legion Intelligence Hero: Skrap the Scavenger
- Skrap is a cunning scavenger from the Seradati Plains who once roamed the desolate landscape gathering carrion to feed himself and occasionally sell in the rare event he encountered another living thing. Now he hoards every daemon carcass he can find to nourish his destructive, ravenous pet Vorax in the war against the Hellbourne. Skrap prefers to skulk along the edges of combat, harassing the enemy and harvesting their remains until he has enough to feed Vorax, who revels in charging forward and demolishing everything in its path.

Skrap Abilities

Mousetrap (Q)
- Target an area to throw a Mousetrap there, dealing 60/80/100/120 Magic Damage and applying a Mini-Stun.
- After arming, the Mousetrap will chase the first enemy that comes within range (prioritizing heroes), dealing 80/100/120/140 Magic Damage and applying a 1.25/1.5/1.75/2 second Stun to nearby enemies.
- Mousetrap lives for 40 seconds.

Zoomerang (W)
- Target a location to throw a Zoomerang in that direction. Deals 60/80/100/120 Magic Damage and applies a stacking 20% Movement Speed Slow to enemy units. Zoomerang can hit again on the way back.
- Cooldown reduced by 8 seconds if caught or 4 seconds if picked up from ground. Zoomerang collects morsels while flying.

Scavenge (E)
- Passively allows Skrap to pick up morsels from dead units, granting 8 experience each. Dying will reduce collected morsels by 30%.

Unleash Vorax (R)
- Choose a lane to spawn Vorax, an uncontrollable monster with 2000/3500/5000 Health and 120/150/180 Attack Damage, in that lane.
- Vorax will push the lane, Disarming enemy towers on attack, but hurting itself.
- Vorax is visible to enemies at all times.

New Skrap Debut Edition Avatar: Bone Collector
- Every day countless living things die in The Great Waste -- from natural causes and otherwise --  but the landscape is oddly devoid of carcasses. This is because of the cunning Bone Collector of the Great Waste, who strips the putrid corpses of maggot-ridden meat and offal before cleaning the bones and offering them to the true alpha scavenger of the Waste, the Bonefeast Vorax. This species much prefers the satisfying crunch of dead marrow, but the Bonefeast and his Collector will attack living flesh just to get to the tasty bones within.

New Skrap Avatar: Warlock
- The Blood Crystals buried deep within the southern range of the Iron Mountains are the only remains of the powerful Mordant Paragons, a clan of twisted sorcerers who chose to bury themselves in the endless, black caverns rather than face the justice of the Order of the Chapel. Their petrified blood is valued for its magical properties, but the scavenging creature known as Warlock skulks through the catacombs and harvests the gems because of their ability to manifest the Blood Crystal Vorax, a fearsome monster created by the Mordant Paragons to protect their nefarious rituals. Whoever carries the Blood Crystals can summon the Vorax, but controlling it is another story...

= Sunburn Bay =

Every year, the Inner Sea's Sunburn Bay is flooded with vacationers looking for sun, fun, and respite from the cold, bloody steel and stone of the war between the Legion and Hellbourne. The hot sand and cool waves are neutral territory, where you might find Legionnaire rubbing suntan oil on all eight of Arachna's legs. Once they leave the beach it's back to death and despair, so everyone enjoy the rest and relaxation while it lasts!

New Gold Edition Sunburn Bay Behemoth Avatar: Surfer Dude Behemoth
- Surfer Dude Behemoth is amped to carve up some waves instead of enemies for a while, but if any kooks try to get aggro on his epic ripping he might have to drop in and share a little shockwave with them, especially if any beach bunnies are watching.

New Sunburn Bay Rhapsody Avatar: Luau Rhapsody
- When the sun finally goes down on Sunburn Bay it's time to light the tiki torches, sit down for the evening feast and get ready for the real party to start. Luau Rhapsody leads the singing and dancing with her smooth melodies and artful hula choreography, and those who can't keep up (cough Surfer Behe cough) are welcome to watch and make leis for everyone else.

New Sunburn Bay Valkyrie Avatar: Beach Babe Valk
- Sunburn Bay is a beacon of warmth and relaxation for the Valkyries of the Frost Fields, who go months at a time without seeing the sun and will die within seconds if they touch the frigid waters of the Boreal Sea. The vacationing males certainly don't mind these Nordic warriors shedding their bulky plate and mail for holiday bikinis, but they are baffled that the armor stats don't decrease too...

= Zodiac =

New Limited Edition Zodiac Night Hound Avatar: Leo
- Broken and defeated by Hercules, the Nemean Lion known as Leo was memorialized among the stars as a constellation where he has watched for centuries as the warriors of Newerth vie for supremacy. He was once a scourge to the Greeks, using stealth and surprise to capture maidens, who he took to his cave as bait for would-be rescuers. But his years in the heavens observing the goodwill of the men, women and beasts of the Legion have tempered his fury and malice, and now he returns to stand with Hercules and his fellow warriors to stalk the Hellbourne.

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

= General =

- Following community feedback, certain in-game sound announcements are no longer queued or have had their queue times reduced, which should resolve kill streak announcements being heavily delayed.

Items
- Items in your inventory and stash are now movable while dead
- Items can be purchased while dead, and will go into your inventory
- Items purchased while alive cannot be sold while dead
- At the time of death, items instantly lose their 100% refund grace period timer

Interface & Smartcasting
- Smartcasting now works correctly for the bottom row of item slots
- Hero names are no longer cut off when you mouse over their hero icons in the scoreboard
- There should no longer be any duplicate console errors related to replays

= Heroes =

Deadlift
- Resurrection now works properly if the target's corpse gets dragged more than 250 units from the Gravestone

Kane
- Balance of Power aura states are no longer considered Buffs
*Prevents Kane from receiving free assists

= Items =

Merrick's Bounty
- Properly plays a sound when its charges are consumed

Version 3.7.4
-------------
01 July 2015

== Design ==

Hellbringer
+ Hellbringer's kit is still providing an exceptional amount of utility and has left him sitting stronger than he should. This is another set of nerfs to bring him in line and make him more manageable during the laning phase.

Demon Strike (Q)
- Cast range lowered from 700 to 600
- Projectile travel distance lowered from 1000 to 600 units
* Net "effective range" reduced from 1700 to 1200

Demonic Wave (W)
- Cast range lowered from 1250 to 1000
- Projectile lifetime decreased from 1.5 seconds to 0.95 seconds
- Net "effective range" lowered from 1610 to 1170

Evil Presence (E)
- Lifesteal lowered from 8/16/24/32% to 5/10/15/20%

Kane
+ The purpose of Kane is to lock down a carry for a set time and ensure they do no damage to him or anyone else. The damage sap was causing him to just kill every carry he locked down which is more in-line with what Pandamonium should be doing. These changes are aimed at allowing Kane to still be the counter-carry superstar, but be more reliant on awesome auras than high kill counts.
- Base Strength decreased from 24 to 22

Force of Balance (W)
- HP/Mana Regeneration rescaled from 1/2/3/4% to 1/2.5/4/5.5% of the unit's missing HP/Mana, respectively

Steel Resolve (E)
- Damage sap changed to damage reduction. Kane no longer gains any damage. Damage is reduced by 20% per charge (20/40/60/80% at max charges)
- Max charges rescaled from 4 to 1/2/3/4

Face Off (R)
- Cooldown increased from 50/40/30 seconds to 60/50/40 seconds
- Using this skill on a tower puts this skill on a 20-second cooldown instead of the regular cooldown duration
- Applies 1 charge of Kane's Anguish (Steel Resolve state) on the enemy target upon being cast

New Independence Day Holiday Edition Scout Avatar: Continental Rebel
- For too long, the damnable Redcoats have taxed our Goblin Coins without allowing representation! We tried throwing their tea into Blind Man's Harbor, but all they did was drink our ale and institute the Hut Act, demanding we allow enemy soldiers shelter in our homes! Intolerable! Now we will amass arms and fight back! But we must be wary, patriots--the Redcoats can outnumber and outspend us at every junction--so we must employ hit-and-run, ambush tactics to thin their ranks. Don't let them see you until it's too late, then show them your full patriotism in a cloud of musketry!

New Independence Day Holiday Edition Flint Beastwood Avatar: Redcoat Flint
- These rebels have gone too far! They are too stupid to realize they were better off under our control, and now they're delusional enough to think they can beat us in open warfare. Ludicrous! We will bring them to their knees with overwhelming numbers, discipline and volley fire, and when they beg for mercy and a chance to rejoin our glorious Empire we will demonstrate the primary trait of a supreme nation: ruthlessness!

New War Effort Magebane Avatar: Acheron of Mana Aeacus
- When he began his rule as one of the Three Judges of All Hells, Aeacus reserved Acheron, the river of woe, as one of his harshest punishments for the lamentable souls brought before him for using magic during their time among the living. The damned were forced to stand eternally in the frigid currents, which pulled the precious mana from every pore of their body, while hounds and eels tore at their limbs.

= General =

New Hammerstorm Avatar: Carnystorm
- Carnystorm the Strongman first developed his growing muscles by grooming and curling his impressive infant mustache, and as he matured his brawn and whiskers continued to develop into the extraordinary specimens you now behold. He could have easily coasted through Adkarna's bootcamp and become a hero of the Legion, but he believed his physical gifts were bestowed upon him to entertain, not harm. It was obvious: only the Illustrious Freak Show of the Divine Coterie was good enough to feature Carnystorm's outlandish feats of strength, including smashing boulders with a single blow of his massive hammer--a skill that will come in handy when the daemons come to the carnival.

New Silhouette Avatar: Cirque du Silhouette
- Cirque du Silhouette was trained daily from a young age by the finest performers of the Divine Coterie to dazzle audiences with her stunning acrobatic skills. She did not know her artistry was also a lethal combination of finesse, balance, and strength until she had to use her tightrope walking and knife throwing to escape a Hellbourne ambush. Since that day, she has made more fans by skewering daemons than by dangling and spinning from aerial ribbons, but with her elite skills, why not do both at the same time?

New Gold Edition Puppet Master Avatar: Freakshow
- Any stupid clown can get laughs--Freakshow and his marionette Patsy judge their performances on how many screams of terror they get. But they aren't heartless! If an audience member dies before the show is over, Freakshow and Patsy have the body removed immediately and stored on ice backstage. It is bad taste to make the crowd sit with something so disturbing, and the bodies taste bad if they're allowed to bloat.

New Thai Announcer: SEA Announcer

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

= General =

- Banning Draft/Random Draft games will no longer include heroes who are disabled in Tournament Mode
- In Capture the Flag, the flag is no longer deleted upon being terminated if the flag is carried by the terminated hero
- If two events trigger at the same time and both events play an announcer, the announcer audio properly plays one after the other rather than playing at the same time
* Example: The announcements of the flag pickups in Capture the Flag play one after the other if both flags are captured at the same time
- All HoNiversary decorations have been removed

= Heroes =

Dampeer
- Invader Dampeer is no longer missing one of his voice lines

Kinesis
- Mass Control target radius tooltip corrected to be 225 units before casting the skill

Legionnaire
- Decapitate boosted with Staff of the Master is fixed to properly refresh Legionnaire's skill cooldowns if Decapitate kills Gemini's Fire/Ice pets
* No other hero pets are affected by this change (e.g. Puppet Master's Voodoo Puppet)

Parasite
- Infested ally creeps now properly apply the Draining Venom state on the target they attack

Prisoner
- Deleted redundant sound folder for Dark Angel Prisoner when casting Prison Break

Puppet Master
- Game Master auto-attack impact sounds are slightly reduced

= Items =

Ioyn Stone
- Ioyn Stone's state icon is now correct if it stores a Refreshment Rune and uses it on an ally hero

Restoration Stone
- Now properly calculates the cooldown when a skill's sub-ability temporarily replaces its main ability
* Prevents cooldown exploits with certain abilities
* In other words, if Sand Wraith uses Mirage, then uses Restoration Stone after Sand Wraith's Mirage sub-ability appears, then the cooldown on Restoration Stone will be (30 + Mirage_Cooldown) seconds, rather than 30 seconds

Sol's Bulwark
- Typo in script fixed for the enemy aura (effecttype changed from Buff to Debuff)

== Bug Fixes & Optimizations ==

= General =

- N/A and +?/-? have been removed from the pick screen UI
- The Capture the Flag loading bar in matchmaking properly shows the player who is queueing and not the group leader's bar
- Illusions of avatars that "evolve" over the course of a game properly represent the current visuals of that avatar
* An example would be Doctor Gamer and his different forms
- Sound channels fade in & out properly when the following abilities are used at the same time:
* Rhapsody's Disco Inferno and Protective Melody
* Oogie's Conflagration and Primal Surge

= Tournament Rules =

- Riptide has been removed from tournament rules
- Night Hound has been removed from tournament rules

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= Hero Balance =

Engineer
+ Mines are quicker to place now and can reach lethal levels with lower amounts of mines. These changes are aimed at lessening the burst damage of throwing mines at enemy players and making players have to use more mines to gain high lethality. 

Spider Mines (E)
- Spider mines no longer block creep spawns.
- Magic Damage reduced from 175/250/325/400 to 125/200/275/350
* Total damage with 6 Spider Mines reduced from 1050/1500/1950/2400 to 750/1200/1650/2100
- Now have a 1 second arming time when they reach their destination
- Cooldown between placing mines increased from 3.5 to 5 seconds

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hellbringer
+ Some more tweaks to lessen the amount of high damage and in turn high sustain Hellbringer is achieving.

Evil Presence (E)
- Passive heal from all damage dealt by Hellbringer reduced from 15/20/25/30% to 8/16/24/32%

Summon Malphas (R)
- Malphas Move Speed lowered from 375/400/425 to 350/375/400

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keeper of the Forest
+ A sizable buff to an underwhelming start. These changes should help the usability of Nature's Sentinel outside the ultimate combo.

Nature's Sentinel (W)
- Cast time reduced from 250 to 100
- Increased cast range from 300 to 450
- Increased attack radius from 200 to 350
- Damage rescaled from 30 from each branch to 25 + 5% of Keeper's Attack Damage

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Night Hound
+ We wanted to bring something unique to how you played a stealth hero with Night Hound. The charge system combined with the level one Invisibility was causing a high amount of frustration. It was clear we needed to change one or the other. We have something in testing that could be better in the future, but it will need the appropriate time to make sure it is exactly what we want for Night Hound.

Invisibility (R)
- Can now be leveled at 1/6/11
- Charge system removed
- Fade Time increased from 2.5/2/1.5 to 3.5/2.5/1.5
- Now grants 0/6/12 Agility

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parallax
+ Parallax can achieve a monster amount of high damage but with that high damage we wanted a high cost. With these changes he should be able to make it through the earlier game a bit easier and make use of his high mobility.
- Base Intelligence increased from 24 to 26
- Intelligence gain per level increased from 2.4 to 2.7

Fulcrum Shift(Q)
- Range increased from 700 to 900
- Leash range increased from 1100 to 1200
- Damage increased from 0/45/65/65/85 to 0/65/85/85/105

Ionic Dash(W)
- Range increased from 725 to 925

Earthshatter (R)
- Initial mana cost decreased from 125/200/275 to 100/175/250
- Mana cost per second decreased from 5% to 3% of Parallax's max mana pool
- Cooldown reduced from 90/75/60 seconds to 70/60/50 seconds

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Riptide
+ Riptide's ultimate did not quite hit the mark in use and feel. The adjustments below should make it much better in both those categories.

Eye of the Storm (R)
- Now makes Riptide Magic Immune
- Turning is now twice as easy

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

War Beast
+ Warbeast was gaining too much free gold from Battle Cry and the strengths that this provides should have a higher cost, these changes will address this.

Battle Cry (W)
- Mana cost increased from 15/10/5/0 to 25/20/15/10

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wildsoul
+ Wildsoul is a unique hero due to his "two hero feel" and 12 inventory slots to fill. We want Wildsoul to be able to achieve a higher farm so he can attempt to fill those slots; however, he was gaining too much sustainability and damage for free.

New War Effort Trophy Avatar: Flint Beastwood
- The only way to get this rare, auspicious avatar is to be ranked among The War Effort's top 50 at the end of each 28-day cycle, so keep checking that leaderboard and completing those quests! Even the staff can't get the Trophy avatars!

New 8-Bit Doctor Repulsor Avatar: Doctor Gamer
- Dr. Gamer didn't always have a PhD in video gaming -- he started out as a console-loving kid in his parents' basement in Arcadia, and as he matured his skill level and choice of electronic entertainment evolved right along with him until he became the smartest, most strategic gamer in all of Arcadia. Now that he has access to Newerth it's time to give these combative heathens a doctorate-level schooling in proper gaming, and maybe do some digging into this eSports thing the Game Master told him about...

New Gold Edition A.R.M.S. Pestilence Avatar:  Invader Pestilence
- When Pestilence abandoned the Moon Queen and her hive to side with the Hellbourne, he expected his soldier beetles to follow. Instead, they tried to bring his head back to the queen to prove their loyalty. Pestilence annihilated his entire army and fled to Hell's Keep, where the Electrician was delighted at the opportunity to create a brigade of insect shock troopers inspired by the vicious Pestilence. Technology failed him until the breakthrough of the A.R.M.S. Invader suits, which the Electrician used to create this prototype, a robotic scourge obedient to the ruthless hive mind of Pestilence. 

= Black Legion =

New Silhouette Black Legion Avatar: Hexa
- Chosen from the silent hunters of the Hidden Village of the Scout, Hexa of the Black Legion prefers to execute her assassination jobs as a solo operator -- Quintan and the others are a bit too overt for her tastes. Those lads can be a useful distraction though, and on the occasions when Hexa works in tandem with the entire Black Legion the Hellbourne forces invariably flood toward the swath of carnage caused by Quint and the boys while the enemy commander watches from afar in frustration and outrage. Until Hexa's blade settles across his throat and the commander realizes the true purpose of the attack.

New Master of Arms Black Legion Avatar: Waru
- Waru may be the most valuable member of the Black Legion (except for Unum, if you happen to be bleeding out at the moment). He can switch from blistering covering fire to accurate kill shots without breaking stride, and when Quintan's ax gets dull from cracking too many skulls or Troika's flamethrower sputters out, it's Waru who pulls a replacement from his pack to keep every member of the Black Legion in the fight. It doesn't matter to Waru who gets the kills as long as they happen on the enemy's side.

New Kane Black Legion Avatar: Septar
- Septar is the brash wildcard of the Black Legion. He was accused of deserting his former unit of Jeraziah's Royal Guard the night before a battle, but when the King advanced into
enemy territory at dawn he and his soldiers found Septar waiting among dozens of enemy dead. â€œThought I'd save you all the trouble,â€ Septar said.
He has elite skills in melee combat and a tendency to seek out the most powerful opponent among the enemy ranks and challenge him to single combat. Since the Hellbourne has no honor, this ends up with him fighting dozens of enemies, which suits him fine, as long as his chainsword doesn't bog down.

== Hero Balance ==

Hellbringer
+ We are watching all heroes very closely with this new large patch and we want to make sure we are quick to address any problems. Hellbringer was achieving too much of an impact in the earlier stages due to the efficiency of his Demon Strike. With these changes we are looking to see him peak a little later in the game and reduce some of his burst.
 
Demon Strike (Q):
- Magic Damage reduced from 100/150/200/250 to 80/120/160/160
- Max charges decreased from 2 to 1/1/1/2

Evil Presence (E):
- Movement Speed Slow reduced from 20/30/40/50% to 25% at all levels

== New Game Mode ==

Capture the Flag
+ It's finally here! After taking the gold medal in Heroes of Newerth's Sol's Theatre Contest, Capture the Flag (previously known as Greenlands) is making its debut in HoN's Matchmaking.

+ The HoN design team and SBT have been working hand-in-hand with the map's creators, HyperXewl and Kawaiiiii to test and polish the map ensuring that it meets the community's expectations.

+ In addition to the rigorous testing, the map received a complete makeover from the Content team and now looks as smooth as it plays.

+ Capture the Flag map information and tips are shown while loading and queueing for a Capture the Flag game

Here is a list of the rules for Capture the Flag and how it differs from Forests of Caldavar:
* To see the Sol's Theatre Competition, head here: http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/theatre

Pick Mode:
- Blind Ban

Rules:
- At the start of the game there is a time for item purchasing where a player cannot leave the base (20 seconds)
- Each team has a flag located in its respective base
* Right-clicking the enemy flag picks it up
* Dying while carrying the enemy flag drops it at your current location
* If on the ground, the flag auto-returns to its base after 10 seconds
* Right-clicking your team's flag instantly returns it to your base

- Special states while carrying the flag:
* Grants the other team vision of you at all times (you are revealed as well)
* Portal Key cannot be used 
* Instantly teleporting over 2000 units drops the flag
* Incoming damage is amplified and the longer you hold the flag, the more damage you take
* Healing received and Health Regeneration are reduced by 50%

- Players may drop the flag using a new ability called Flag Drop
* The default hotkey for Flag Drop is 'i'
* This does not reset the damage multiplier
* Ability has a 20-second cooldown

- A flag capture (or cap) occurs when you carry the enemy flag to your base while your flag is in place
- Right-clicking your flag pedestal while holding the enemy flag scores the flag capture
* You cannot capture the flag if the enemy has taken your flag
- A flag capture earns a point for the capping team and resets the location of the enemy flag back to their base
- 5 flag captures for one team equals victory

Additional Rules:
- Hero or creep kills are worth 0 XP and a minor amount of gold
- All players are given a static 660 GPM and 156 experience per minute throughout the game
* All players hit max level at the 25 minute mark
- Capturing a flag awards all players on the capping team 350 gold
- An indestructible, unselectable tower guards each base; it hits very hard but is slow and non-lethal
- Shops are in each base and at the respawn points
- Wells are outside of the bases and are usable by both teams, but heroes in the wells take significantly increased damage (+170% damage taken)
- There are two hard neutral camps; one each side of the map
- A rune spawns every 60 seconds in the center of the map
* Haste rune cannot appear
- The courier starts the game flying and is invulnerable, invisible, and gives no vision for your team


== New Hero ==

New Hellbourne Intelligence Hero: Parallax the Artificer
- The Artificers are an alien race who gestate within asteroids hurtling through space. When the asteroids impact a planet the Artificers emerge and begin to dismantle the world by disrupting it with the dark matter within their Fulcrums.
Parallax the Artificer has cratered on Newerth after destroying Andromeda's home planet of Ambia centuries ago, and the Hellbourne corruption oozing from the Scar senses an opportunity to coalesce with this dark matter and spread beyond Newerth.

- Ability 1: Fulcrum Shift
* Parallax forces the Fulcrum to move toward a target location dealing magic damage to targets along the way.
* Target location to move the Fulcrum to that location, consuming a charge. Enemies hit along its path are dealt (10% Max Mana + 0/65/75/75/85) Magic Damage. Max of 1/1/1/2/2 charges that refresh every 9/8/7/6/5 seconds.

- Ability 2: Ionic Dash
* Parallax uses the power of the Fulcrum to quickly send himself to its location, dealing magic damage and silencing enemy units along the way.
* Activate to dash towards the Fulcrum, dealing 75/95/115/135 Magic Damage and silencing enemies hit along the way for 1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds. Hitting an enemy hero with Ionic Dash will reset the cooldown of the ability.

- Ability 3: Dark Mana
* The Fulcrum's hunger for destruction rewards Parallax's aggression with extra Max Mana.
* Passively grants a charge when damaging enemy heroes with abilities; each charge gives 2/5/8/11 Max Mana.
* Enemy heroes within a 225 radius of the Fulcrum will lose mana per second equal to 8 +0.5 per charge.
* 20% of charges are lost on death, up to a maximum of 5 charges.

- Ability 4: Earthshatter
* Parallax uses his connection with the Fulcrum to create a powerful field around himself and the Fulcrum, dealing massive magic damage to enemy heroes inside of it.
* Activate to create an area tether between Parallax and the Fulcrum.
* While active, enemy heroes within the area are dealt Magic Damage per second based on the difference between Parallax's Max Mana and the enemy hero's.
* While active, Parallax's Movement Speed is increased by 5/10/15% and enemy heroes within the area are slowed by up to 30%.
* Drains 5 % Max Mana per second.

- New Parallax Avatar: Thai Warrior
* Thai Warrior Parallax is a mobile hub of blessings and celebration for the Thai New Year. Wherever he goes, the party goes with him and he's very happy and excited to spread the cleansing, jasmine-scented waters and protective white powders of these sacred rites. Happy New Year, and may this celebration refresh all good things in your life and bring you blessings for the coming year!

- New Parallax Avatar: High Priestess
* The High Priestess of Arasunia is the Mother to all Sisters of the Sacred Order, guiding them in the pure ways of Sol and performing the divine rituals that welcome all lost souls into the fold. She carries with her a blessed ossuary containing the crumbled, ashen remains of the first High Priestess, Saint Eliana, who traveled Newerth with a bottomless skin of holy water and consecrated the lands upon which the Chapels of Sol would grow. Now the High Priestess must use the ossuary as a weapon, wielding its holy powers to destroy the Hellbourne and the daemonic corruption that permeates the soil they tread upon.

- New lobby music for the Parallax release
- Removed 8-bit music from the maps


== General ==
NOTE: Please uninstall any active mods as this patch includes massive changes. Mods are likely to break until they are updated.

= Multi-Unit Control AI =

+ Multi-Unit Control (MUC) heroes like Tundra, Tremble and Ophelia have always required more time and finesse to play at a high level. This has caused a lot of players to move aways from these heroes when they could enjoy them if it did not require as much from the player. The following changes are aimed at reducing the tediousness of playing a MUC hero, but still allows players with excellent micromanagement skills to maximize hero's potential if they want to micromanage.
- All heroes and items that would allow the player access to another controllable unit will have the option of automated or manual control
- Any unit under automated control will follow the player wherever they go and mimic their commands
- If your hero attacks an enemy hero, then your other units will use their active abilities (if they have some) on that hero
- You can turn off automation by deselecting the option (new button next to glyph and taunt) or by selecting the unit and manually giving them a command

= MMR Compression and Decay System =

+ This tweak to our matchmaking system is aimed at top-end players in order to relieve some of their long queue times. To accomplish this we have compressed everyone above 1800 MMR down to 1800 and implemented an MMR decay system to players above 1800. Starting in June the top 100 players on the ladder every month will now get to show off a unique name color to signify their achievement.
+ While this is just a quick fix to top-end queue times, we are also looking at similar solutions for the opposite end of the MMR range as well as adjusting our matching algorithm for these groups. We will also soon be delving into the creation of a much larger system that will allow for better queue times and a more solid sense of progression for all players.
- All players above 1800 MMR have had their MMR adjusted to 1800
- Players above 1800 MMR who have not played 5 games in any 10-day period will experience MMR decay at a rate of up to 1% of their rating per day until they are back down to 1800 MMR

= MMR Adjustments =

+ In an effort to remove negativity before the match has even started, we have removed the visibility of how much MMR a player may gain or lose in the match they are in.  This will still be visible with the change in MMR after a match ends.

- MMR gain and loss amounts are no longer visible in the hero pick screen


= Guide System Rework =

+ With massive hero changes incoming and new ways to play arising, we will need our guides to reflect this. We decided to not only update every guide in the game to the current retail patch but also simplify and change how the in-game guides work. With this patch you will see a streamlined guide system that tells you exactly what you need to crush your enemies with some options for both offensive and defensive builds. A big thanks to all the SBT players who submitted their guides for this system!
- Introduced new Hero Guide structure
- Removed all existing guides for reworked heroes (Players will need to re-create guides for these heroes)
- Updated default guides for all heroes

= Leaver Strike System =

+ The Leaver Strike System is used during matchmaking games to make sure players are not quitting games early.
- Strikes are earned when a player disconnects from a game and is terminated (can no longer rejoin) from a matchmaking game. This does not apply if the game is conceded or if a player can normally leave a match with no penalty.
- The player can gain several strikes, the first being forgiven. Subsequent strikes will ban the player from matchmaking for an increasingly longer duration. Ranging from 10 minutes to 10 hours depending on how many strikes the player has gotten on their account.
- These strikes are region-based and are held by the chatserver. 10 days from the player's first strike, the strike count will be cleared out and they start from 0 strikes again.
* Strike 1: Forgiven
* Strike 2: 30 mins
* Strike 3: 1 hour
* Strike 4: 2 hours
* Strike 5: 4 hours
* Strike 6+: 10 hours

= Skillshot Hit Percentages =

+ This has been a feature that players have asked for since the beginning of HoN. It can now be a reality, so make sure to brag when you hit every shot! We are open to suggestions for which abilities you would like tracked.
- We now track certain skillshots and display your accuracy with them in chat when you hit someone
* Only counts as a hit when you hit a hero
* Chat message is only displayed to the person playing the hero
- The following abilities are tracked:
* Devourer's Guttling Hook
* Valkyrie's Javelin of Light
* Gauntlet's Grapple

= Smartcasting =

+ This option allows casting abilities by pressing the ability button without the following click.
- Smartcasting is now available in the options menu.
- Self-Cast Modifier will be added in the future.

= Tower Aggression Indicators =

+ There will now be a much more pronounced effect when a tower attacks your hero, allowing players to know exactly when they are being attacked.
- A new "Alert" sound is now played when you have drawn tower aggression
- A new red circle on the ground appears when you have drawn tower aggression, showing you the range of the tower

= Significant Optimizations =

- Loading into the game should be about 50% faster
- Numerous memory optimizations to the client and UI resulting in a reduced memory footprint
- Significant improvements to game server performance and stability such that the in game experience should be greatly improved for players
- The game should no longer freeze for a split-second when the game switches to a new music track
- Darkened the loading screen background to reduce on-screen clutter


== Maps ==

= Map Editor =

+ Added undo/redo support using CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y for all the tools supported by our editor including:
- Blocker tool
- Deform tool
- Foliage tool
- Tile Definitions
- Paint tool
- Water tool

- Right clicking with the water tool now erases/resets properties for existing water

- The sound tool now works the first time you try to use it
- Changed how the sound tool plays placed sounds which fixes most sounds on a map not playing when they should
- Added a visual indicator for the falloff area of sounds
- Fixed the clone behavior of the bot metadata tool so that it properly re-selects the cloned nodes
- The cliff tool now works the first time you try to use it
- Fixed a memory leak in the cliff tool
- Fixed some situations in which the cliff tool would delete cliff pieces added by the same operation while trying to add more cliff pieces
- Added a checkbox to the system bar to enable/disable drawing the navigation grid
- Entities now always properly update/create path blockers as you edit them
- Fixed Water/Fog markers not being properly removed if you deleted them while hovering them
- Made the entities dialogue wider so it is easier to use
- The foliage tool now properly updates size/scale/density changes on all areas of the map


= Map Help Tips =

- Maps will now display a tip in the bottom right corner for 20 seconds
* Clicking on the tip will open a help window that will explain mechanics about the current map
- The following maps have Help Tips added:
* Forests of Caldavar
* Mid Wars

- Kane
- Calamity
- Tarot

+ The following heroes have been removed from Tournament Rules:
- Keeper of the Forest
- Hellbringer
- Wildsoul
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aluna
+ Emerald Red is a great asset for Power Throw, but we felt that her other abilities needed to shine with Emerald Red as well. With these changes, Emerald Red will bring more game-changing power to her entire skillset.
Emerald Lightning (Q)
- Mana cost reduced from 100/110/120/130 to 80/95/110/125
- Emerald Red effect: Max potential number of targets affected increased from 1/2/3/4 to 2/4/6/8

- Emerald Red effect: Emerald Lightning debuff duration on enemies increased from 5 seconds to 8 seconds 
* Matches the buff duration on Aluna

Deja Vu (E)
- Mana cost reduced from 100/110/120/130 to 70/80/90/100

Emerald Red (R)
- Mana cost reduced from 75 to 50
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arachna

Webbed Shot (Q)
- Cooldown removed for early levels
- No longer considered an Attack Modifier
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Armadon
+ Armadon has always been known for his Spine Burst spam and will be seeing more Spine Burst procs with these changes. Players will also experience reduced mandatory button mashing when they have sufficient mana during mid/late-game.

Spine Burst (W)
- No longer has a Cast Time and is non-interrupting
- Can now be toggled (right-clicked) to cast immediately when off cooldown

Armordillo (R)
- Damage reduction required to trigger an instance of Spine Burst decreased from 250 to 150
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Artillery
+ Artillery was heavily limited by his LRM in many ways. This change is aimed at allowing the hero to be more mobile and use his LRM in more hit-and-run type tactics.
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.4 to 1.5

LRM (Q)
- Implemented a charge system on his LRM
- Each rocket equals one charge; maximum of 20. Charges are refreshed every 0.5s (even during channelling)
- Mana cost: 10 base mana cost, 4 per rocket fired
- The spell can be channeled until there is no ammo left or until Artillery runs out of mana (cooldown is removed)
- Grants 1% bonus damage for each rocket fired after the first one for a given channel instance
* It is rewarding to stand still, but you don't waste your spell if you have to move

Homing Missile (R)
- Mana cost decreased from 150/175/200 to 125/150/175
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Balphagore
+ Balphagore is a very strong team-oriented push hero that has fallen off due to a lot of unnecessary micro and Hell on Newerth didn't quite hit the mark later on in the game. These changes are aimed at bringing the power level of Hell on Newerth to a stronger place in the current meta. Micromanagement issues are alleviated with the new Multi-Unit Control AI.

Regurgitate (Q)
- Cone angle for hitting enemies in front of self increased from 100 to 120 degrees

Demonic Pathogen (W)
- Now grants 1 charge to Hell of Newerth every 0.5 seconds for every enemy hero affected
* If Hell of Newerth is on cooldown, reduces its cooldown by 1 second in the same interval instead

Corpse Conversion (E)
- Cast action time lowered from 300 to 200 ms

Hell on Newerth (R)

- Charges now increase the damage by 1/2/3 per charge up to a maximum of 300/450/600 total Magic Damage (100 charges max)
- While on cooldown, now reduces the cooldown by 1 second for every 50 mana spent by nearby enemy heroes
- Volatile Minion health changed from 350 to 300/450/600
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behemoth
+ A boost to games in which Behemoth sees a bit more farm. This will see its largest impact in Mid Wars while still being a solid buff for normal mode as well. 

Enrage (W)
- Bonus Base Damage increased from 50/100/150/200% to 100/175/275/375%
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bombardier
+ Bombardier has fallen off significantly due to high skill requirements with subpar rewards. The changes here are aimed at limiting the frustrations of playing the hero and increasing his power level so he can compete with other hard nukers.

Bombardment (W)
- Now has 1/1/1/2 charges

Boom Dust (E)
- Action type changed from Target Entity to Target Position
- Target a 250 radius area to apply Boom Dust to 2 units closest to the center of the area
- Max charges decreased from 4 to 2
* Total maximum of units affected is still 4
- Charge refresh time increased from 4 seconds to 8 seconds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deadlift
+ Deadlift has shown a significant amount of popularity and is hitting most of our marks, however the 0 mana cost nuke on â€œThe Dead Shall Riseâ€ was not enough of a risk for Deadlift and caused too much frustration when playing against it.

Onslaught (W)
- No longer deals a high amount of damage when you kill someone

The Dead Shall Rise (E)
- Health Cost removed, added a Mana Cost of 60 instead
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demented Shaman
+ Demented Shaman is a top-tier support hero who has fallen off in most of our regions. These quality of life changes are aimed at increasing the effectiveness of his abilities in certain situations. Seriously, this hero should be played more!

Unbreakable (W)
- Cooldown lowered from 45/35/25/15 to 30/25/20/15 seconds
- No longer has an extra frame of delay if he casts it on himself

Storm Cloud (R)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devourer
+ Players will no longer be forced to put an early point in Cadaver Armor to begin gaining charges.

Cadaver Armor (E)
- One point in this skill is automatically acquired at the start of the game, granting the Strength gain passive effects
* Skill now has 5 levels
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doctor Repulsor
+ Another small tweak to Doctor Repulsor that makes him weaker against other ranged heroes, while doing very little to affect his dominance against melee heroes.
- Attack Range lowered from 500 to 450
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emerald Warden
+ We wanted to bring Emerald Warden's traps more to the forefront of the hero. The new trigger sub-ability will also now allow players to exert a little more control over their traps as well.

Hunter's Command (W)
- Magic Damage increased from 60/120/180/240 to 90/155/220/285

Overgrowth (E)
- Overgrowth trap now has the ability to forcefully trigger itself to go off
- Max number of Overgrowth traps increased from 3 to 5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer
+ Having to leave your lane to set up mines left the player underleveled. Additionally, Engineer was often not around to gain the experience from mine kills. Therefore, changes were made to allow Engineer players a better way of utilizing their mines without spending so much time out of lane.

Spider Mines (E)
- Action type changed from Self Position to Target Position
- Cast range increased from 0 to 450
- Max charges increased from 1/2/2/3 to 1/2/3/4
- Max number of mines on the map reduced from 9 to 6
- Charge refresh time reduced from 25 seconds to 15 seconds
- Increase arming time from 1 second to 1.5 seconds
- Magic Damage increased from 150/200/250/300 to 175/250/325/400
- "Destroy Spider Mine" self-destruct ability on the Mine itself moved from the Q slot to the E slot
* Consistency with other self-destruct abilities on gadgets
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gladiator
+ Gladiator brings a unique kit to the game and the excitement of playing with and against him can be felt by everyone. We have systematically buffed this hero patch after patch and we feel this will finally put him where we want him. The new use of Call to Arms will allow Gladiator players to more accurately hit the ability and be more useful in team fights. The early mana pool increase allows Gladiator to be played in a support/roamer role if desired, opening up a wider range of play styles.
- Base Intelligence increased from 16 to 18
- Intelligence growth per level increased from 1.5 to 2.0

Pitfall (Q)
- Damage changed from 0.15s intervals to frame (0.05s) intervals 
* Same total damage, this was just a consistency change

Call to Arms (R)
- Targeting mechanic changed: can target anywhere within cast range.
* Chariot still spawns 2000 units behind the targeted position relative to Gladiator. As a result, the Chariot's travel time is unchanged.
- Radius increased from 400 to 450
- Damage from the damage buffer state changed from non-lethal damage to direct HP removal 
* Prevents allied Portal Keys from going on cooldown and cancelling Bottle/Health Potion/Mana Potion/Striders, etc.
- Damage buffer duration increased from 5/6/7 seconds to 10 seconds at all levels
- Cooldown increased from 60/50/40 seconds to 70/60/50 seconds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gunblade
+ Gunblade is a carry who gains farm through ganking. A lot of players want the hero to have a better farming tool, but it must be understood that heroes like him and Arachna should not be farming lanes much. Instead, they should be running around trying to kill heroes with their exceptional abilities. These changes are made to make Gunblade a little more reliable and to smooth out his gameplay experience.

Crippling Slugs (Q)
- All 3 shots come out regardless of being stunned/silenced/killed midway 
* Prevents a partially wasted nuke if stunned or silenced mid-nuke

Demonic Shield (W)
- Cast action time and cast time reduced to 0
- Can now be used during other orders without interruption

Lethal Range (E)
- Now grants True Strike when Gunblade attacks a hero within 200 range
- Bonus damage is calculated properly when Gunblade has a Wingbow
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hellbringer
+ Hellbringer has suffered from many problems in his lifetime. The major problem was that his skillset was not very active or even visually impactful. A "walking ultimate" to a certain degree, Hellbringer was just not that fun and did not have much impact as a support or solo hero. The new skillset he has received will keep him similar to the old Hellbringer but allows him to be more active, impactful and entertaining. Malphas is now an actual threat on the field, establishing Hellbringer as a new powerhouse in Newerth!

Demon Strike (Q)
- Reworked
- Charge based ability: 2 charges max, restores 1 charge every 15 seconds, 100 mana cost
- Vector targeting: click location and drag
- Upon use, summons a demon at the target location that slowly lands on the ground (takes 0.6 seconds) and rapidly charges in the target direction, dealing 100/150/200/250 magic damage and applying fear for 1 second to enemies in a line.

Demonic Wave (W)
- Reworked
- Action type changed from Target Entity to Target Position
- Cast Range increased from 600 to 1250
- Now sends out a slow-moving cone-shaped wave that applies Death Boil to enemy units hit
* Radius starts out at 110 units and ends at 300 units

Evil Presence (E)
- Reworked
- Summons a passive minion that follows you around and heals you for 15/20/25/30% of all damage dealt to organic enemy units
- Can be activated for 50 mana to send the minion towards a target enemy at max movement speed. Upon reaching the enemy (or after 5 seconds) the minion explodes, slowing enemies in an AoE by 20/30/40/50% and reducing their magic armor by 1/2/3/4 for 5 seconds
* Cast Range of 1200
- This ability has a 15 second cooldown and the healing passive does not work until the minion is revived at the end of the cooldown
- When Hellbringer dies the minion (if present) will explode and apply the effect as well

Summon Malphas (R)
- Now deals 20/40/60 Magic Damage per second for 3 seconds in addition to the instant 100 Magic Damage upon cast
- Only summons 1 Malphas
* Malphas now has 900/1350/1800 HP, 50/75/100 Attack Damage, 375/400/425 movement speed, 5/10/15 armor, 15/20/25 HP Regeneration and 17 Magic Armor

Malphas' Immolate (Q)
- Passive damage increased from 25 to 25/50/75 Magic Damage per second to enemies within a 225 radius

Malphas' Burning Sword (W)
- Reworked
- Now passively gives 25/50/75 Attack Speed

Malphas' Fire Bomb (E)
- Reworked
- Passively throws a fireball every 3 seconds at the closest enemy hero within a 500 radius, dealing 50/75/100 Magic Damage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kane
+ Kane was intended to be one of the most powerful counter-carries we put into the game. The ability to lock down an enemy carry and not die is something he is very good at. However, a lot of his skills were not adequately fulfilling that niche to make him a serious threat to carries. In addition, his passive skill had very little use outside towers or Face Off. These changes are aimed at making him more impactful against carries and a better source of mobile out-of-combat regeneration for his team.
- Magic Armor lowered from 6.5 to 4.5

Balance of Power (W)
- Auras now heal 1/2/3/4% of missing HP and Mana
- No longer has a Movement Speed bonus and penalty on Kane for either aura
- Swap duration for auras reduced from 8/6/4/2 seconds to 2 seconds at all levels

Steel Resolve (E)
- Debuff duration increased from 1.5 seconds to 4 seconds and each autoattack from Kane adds 1 additional charge to the debuff
- The target's autoattacks deal 5/10/15/20% less damage per charge on them
* Kane will deal this amount as Bonus Damage when attacking that target
- Max of 4 charges on any single target

Face Off (R)
- Duration increased from 2.5/3.5/4.5 seconds to 3.5/4.5/5.5 seconds
- Range increased from 450/550/650 to 650
- Duration of the force-attack state resets when Kane and the target meet (i.e. when the arena is formed)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keeper of the Forest
+ Jungling is often a desirable play style in our game and we felt that we were not offering much difference in play styles within the jungle category. Keeper of the Forest's skillset had a lot of overlap with Tempest, who is also a solid jungle hero. With Tempest considered top-tier while Keeper of the Forest was losing traction, we decided to make Keeper of the Forest's second skill (W) more unique. With these changes, Keeper of the Forest is now a solid farmer with some good damage output and sustainability. His ability to carry was also increased.
- Keeper of the Forest has a completely updated and improved base model.

Nature's Veil (Q)
- Cast Range increased from 500 to 800
- Health Regeneration has been removed.
- Can now be cast on structures.

Animate Forest (W)
- Removed
New ability: Nature's Sentinel (W)
- Target Position, 300 Cast Range
- 20/30/40/50 Mana Cost, 25/20/15/10 second Cooldown
- Now creates a Sentinel at the target location. These are considered to be real trees by Keeper's other abilities.
- The center tree has 600 health and can be attacked. Dies in 2 hits from heroes and towers regardless of damage. 30/45/60/75 Gold bounty
- Has 1/2/3/4 smaller trees around it that can't be targeted and deal 30 Physical Damage each, prioritizing heroes. They do not attack structures.
- Nature's Sentinel is disabled if the active tree has taken damage.
* Health of the tree is regenerated quickly within 3 seconds of not taking damage.
- Nature's Sentinel's cooldown restarts if the tree is killed 

Entmoot (E)
- Now also heals you for 0.3% of max health per charge on each attack Keeper makes against enemy units (max of 1.5% healed per hit with 5 charges)
* This is not lifesteal, as that heals you based on damage done. This heals you based on your max health only
* Works when you attack structures
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Klanx
+ Goon squad needed to be toned down a bit in terms of sheer utility. The ability to easily siege towers and was not an intended function of the hero. We also noticed hitbox issues with flight that was making skill shots slightly harder to hit.

HAWK (W)
- Lowered flight height so it is easier to land skill shots against him

Goon Squad (R)
- No longer deals damage to structures
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maliken
+ A minor ability change for Maliken that will give him more control over his Sword Throw.

Sword Throw (Q)
- Changing Sword of the Damned (W) mode while the sword is in mid-flight changes the sword and all effects dynamically
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Master of Arms 
+ Master of Arms is a very fun and effective hero and a lot of you may wonder why we are changing him at all. A lot of his abilities were mismatched to his roles. If he wanted to carry he needed to use the Repeater but the Pulse Cannon's Master's Call? His Pulse Cannon's Charged Shot was massively effective while his Repeater's Blast Shot was useless in the vast majority of scenarios. We decided to spice the hero up a bit and make his Pulse Cannon form a solid choice for early game and his Repeater all about carrying. Two solid play styles of long range harass or close range damage form the play style now. Everything is in the right place and the hero is a ton of fun now!
- Strength decreased from 17 to 15
- Strength per level decreased from 1.8 to 1.5
- Agility per level decreased from 2.6 to 2.5
- Intelligence increased from 18 to 20
- Intelligence per level increased from 2 to 2.4

Pulse Cannon mode renamed to Bulldozer mode
Charged Shot (Q)
- Cast Range increased from 500 to 800
- Mana cost rescaled from 85/95/105/115 to 100
- Cooldown decreased from 12 to 10 seconds
- Stun duration decreased from 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8 seconds to 1/1.2/1.4/1.6 seconds
- Damage decreased from 75/125/175/225 to 50/100/150/200

Bulldozer (E)
- Adds 75/75/100/125/150 Attack range and 0/10/20/30/40 Attack damage, but reduces Attack Speed by 20%

Master's Call (R)
- Now grants a 250/350/450 post-mitigation Damage Shield for 10 seconds

Repeater mode renamed to Cheetah mode
Blast Shot (Q)
- Reworked
- Cast Range of 550
- Mana Cost of 80
- Fires a projectile that deals 100/150/200/250 Magic Damage and immobilizes the target for 1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds on impact

Cheetah (E)
- Reduces Attack Damage by 20% only against heroes and increases Attack Speed by 0/100/200/300/400
* Can shoot 12 bullets before needing to reload
* Reloading takes 4 seconds

Master's Call renamed to Adrenaline Kryo Enhancer
Adrenaline Kryo Enhancer (R)
- Now grants 75/125/175 Movement Speed, 50/75/100 Cast Speed and 20/40/60 Damage for 5 seconds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkey King
+ Monkey King has seen a fair share of the nerf bat because of how hard and frustrating it was to play against him. We took it a bit too far on increasing his overall mana consumption. This did not affect the frustration of playing against the hero all that much. Therefore, the mana cost of Vault was reduced.

Heavenly Vault (W)
- Mana cost reduced to 120 at all levels from 120/130/140/150
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moraxus
+ These changes are aimed at increasing Moraxus' effectiveness with the challenging timing issues he faces and rewards him more for successful execution. The threat of Arcane Shield is real and it makes playing against Moraxus more dangerous than ever.

Arcane Shield (W)
- Duration of the spellblock state increased from 2 seconds to 2.5 seconds
- Duration of the boost increased from 5 to 6 seconds
- Now grants 40/60/80/100% Slow Resistance on the boost
- Bonus Attack Damage on the boost increased from 20/40/60/80 to 60/80/100/120
- Bonus Movement Speed on the boost increased from 70/110/150/190 to 200

More Axes (E)
- Axes now replenish every 5 seconds, down from 8/7/6/5
- If someone is hit with 4 axes without the debuff falling off, they are immobilized for 1.5 seconds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Myrmidon
+ Magic Carp has always been an ability that had little purpose on its own and felt extremely weak at impact. The only solid choice in using it was to proc Null Stones. These changes are aimed at giving Myrmidon more teamfight utility and increasing his durability.

Magic Carp (W)
- Now targets an area (300 radius) instead of a unit
- Spawns a Magic Carp for each enemy hero in the target area
* No longer works on creeps as a result

Forced Evolution (R)
- Forced Evolution state duration increased from 15 to 20 seconds
- Now gains 5/10/15 Magic Armor
- Max Health gained increased from 200/300/400 to 200/400/600
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Night Hound
+ Night Hound now has more choices in leveling and a solid niche as a potential suicide hero. He also becomes the first hero that can level Invisibility at levels 1/3/5!

Invisibility (R)
- Gains 1 attack, skill cast or item activation before being revealed
* Can still be revealed through eye, dust, and wards
- This charge only refreshes after he attacks/uses a skill or an item again
- Can be leveled at level 1/3/5
- No longer grants bonus Agility
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nomad
+ Nomad receives quality of life changes that allow him to get more consistent damage opportunities.

True Strike/Mirage Strike (W)
- True Strike now sets Nomad's Movement Speed to 600 until he hits the target
- Mirage Strike now sets the illusion's Movement Speed to 600 until it hits the target
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plague Rider
+ Plague Rider now has stronger suicide options to keep him relevant.

Extinguish (E)
- Cooldown reduced from 55/50/45/40 seconds to 50/45/40/35 seconds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pollywog Priest
+ These changes are simple and revert Pollywog Priest back to the old days when he could consistently ward trap and harass with his Electric Jolt.

Electric Jolt (Q)
- No longer deals damage in a 500 radius around the target. Instead, creates a large cone that starts at Pollywog and travels 1210 units away
* This is how Pollywog Priest used to function in the past

Voodoo Wards (R)
- Bound radius increased from 10 to 16
* Target now has a slightly harder time escaping a ward trap
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riptide
+ Riptide has always suffered from being a very limited hero with not too many options. This rework is meant to give the hero more options in the ganking territory and provide a real way to play outside of the middle lane. The new Eye of the Storm will accomplish what the old Eye of the Storm was trying to: make Riptide a constant threat on the map.
- Check the Content section for information on the completely redesigned base model for Riptid

Undertow (W)
- Cooldown decreased from 45/40/35/30 to 25/20/15/10 seconds
- Damage rescaled to 50/100/150/200 to all enemy units (from 100/125/150/175 to heroes and 150/200/250/300 to units)
- Puddles now only stay for 3 seconds (down from 20)
- Now applies a 30% slow for 3 seconds in a 250 radius upon reaching the end

In My Element (E)
- Linger time increased from 1 to 1.5 seconds
- Now has an additional activation on top of the passive effects while in water
- 20 mana cost, 45 second cooldown
- Upon activation, creates a 600 radius permanent puddle of water
* Only 1 of these puddles can be active at a time

Eye of the Storm (R)
- Reworked
- Mana Cost increased from 50 to 150
- Cooldown decreased from 120 to 80 seconds
- Now a 20 second channel
- Upon cast Riptide becomes a whirlpool of water charging in the target direction
- Riptide gains speed slowly, up to a maximum speed of 600 over 5 seconds
* Can travel over any obstacle, tree, or cliff while charging
- Hitting the (R) button again while charging will change the direction of the charge slowly
* Channeling is manually cancelled if you right-click the ground to move
- Silences and stuns will not interrupt this channel while moving
- Upon contact with an enemy hero or right-clicking, the whirlpool explodes in a 400 radius area, stunning enemies for 1-second and pushing them back
- Enemies hit take up to 200/300/400 Magic Damage based on how long you have been channeling
- Enemies hit have a 100% tapering Movement Speed Slow applied to them for 5 seconds and are considered in water for this duration
* Everything-walking lingers for 1 second
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sand Wraith
+ Small quality of life change for his weak slow from Desert's Curse.

Desert's Curse (Q)
- Movement Speed slow increased from 8/12/16/20% to 12/16/20/24% 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soulstealer
+ Soulstealer has been a staple hero for a long time, but he has been limited in other modes (e.g. Mid Wars and Casual Mode) because of his soul mechanic. We want to allow Soulstealer to have a less frustrating farm mechanic and a better way of gaining souls in all modes! Mid Wars Soulstealer, here I come!

Soulsteal (W)
- Hero kills grant 5 souls to Soulstealer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swiftblade
+ Swiftblade is receiving another small tweak to make him play a slightly tighter game to achieve what he was before.

Swift Slashes (R)
- Range decreased from 450 to 400
- Radius for target checks decreased from 450 to 400
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tundra
+ Tundra has always been a strong hero. However, the changing metagame and the tedium of playing the hero created a high demand for changes. These tweaks are aimed at giving more options to Tundra's minions and making his Piercing Shards ability retain its power during mid/late-game.

Piercing Shards (Q)
- Total Mixed Damage increased from 180/240/300/360 to 190/260/330/400

Call of Winter (W)
- Both Shiver and Coeurl now get a new ability: Patrol
- Upon use, orders the unit to patrol (move back and forth) between the current and the target position
* Canceled upon issuing any command to them
- Coeurl (dog) will attack any enemies he encounters along the patrolling line (this cancels patrolling)
- Can be used on an allied unit to follow and assist it (attack the targets it attacks, not attacking at all otherwise)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Valkyrie
+ Valkyrie is a classic hero we wanted to reward for hitting arguably one of the hardest skill shots in the game. With this change she can be more active and more of an unseen threat.

Javelin of Light (W)
- Cooldown reduced from 25 seconds to 20 seconds
- Range increased from 3000 to 7000
- If the Javelin travels farther than 2000/1750/1500/1250 units (distance travelled required to apply a 5-second stun) and hits someone, then up to 100/200/300/400 bonus Magic Damage is dealt
* Bonus damage scales linearly up to 6000 units travelled
* Any distance past this will apply the maximum bonus damage

Prism (R)
- Now has clearer visuals to distinguish fade time from full invisibility
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wildsoul
+ Wildsoul has been at the bottom of the barrel for well over a year now. With the speed of the game and the high damage HoN brings, it took too long and was too hard to actually get to a point where Wildsoul could carry. We also noticed that it wasn't the most fun thing in the world playing against a Wildsoul's Booboo that was bashing down your towers for 250+ damage a swing or running down your supports with the damage from Mock of Brilliance. With this rework Wildsoul will become the powerhouse carry he once was while not being as frustrating to play against.

Summon Booboo (Q)
- Cooldown changed from 120 seconds to 30 seconds, but the cooldown only starts after Booboo dies
- While Booboo is alive, can use the ability again to Return Booboo to your side if he hasn't taken hero damage lately

Wild (W)
- Cooldown decreased from 30 to 20 seconds
- Mana Cost increased from 50 to 50/60/70/80
- Upon use, grants Wildsoul and Booboo 10/15/20/25 Attack Speed and 4/6/8/10% Movement Speed for 45 seconds
* For the first ten seconds, this effect is doubled

Natural Attunement (E)
- Reworked
- Previous bonuses removed
- Now grants 2/3/4/5 HP Regeneration and 0.5/1/1.5/2 Mana Regeneration to Wildsoul and 10/15/20/25% Lifesteal to Booboo
* Also applies the lifesteal to any other units you own, such as Puzzlebox summons

Bear Form (R)
- Reworked
- Now grants a copy of all of Booboo's abilities to Wildsoul while in Bear form
* This depends on how much you have leveled Summon Booboo
* This replaces Wild Soul's Wild (W) and Natural Attunement (E) with Booboo's Swipe (W) and Alpha Male (E)
* Booboo's Frenzy (R) is added passively
* Cooldowns are saved between switching forms
- While Bear Form is active, Wildsoul and Booboo will now share all incoming damage (40% of all damage taken is instead taken by the other)
- Bear form no longer grants any health. Instead, grants 5/10/15 Armor, all bonuses of Natural Attunement (Regenerations and Lifesteal), and still changes you into a Melee hero.

+ Essentially, this ability now gives you 30/40/50 seconds of Bear Form that you can use up as you deem necessary. You must effectively spend at least half of the time in human form.
- Cast time completely removed (no longer interrupts walking)
- Activation Mana Cost increased from 25 to 50
* Mana Cost to deactivate decreased from 25 to 0
- This ability is now charge based and has 30/40/50 max charges
* When you learn this ability you gain 30 charges
* Upon leveling this ability up you gain 10 charges immediately
- While Bear Form is active you consume 1 charge per second
- While Bear Form is not active you regain 1 charge per second
* Can turn back and forth freely with a 1-second cooldown
- Upon reaching 0 charges Bear Form deactivates
- Requires at least 5 charges to activate
- No longer disjoints upon use

Booboo
- Health decreased from 1400/1800/2300/2700 to 1400/1600/1800/2000
- Damage increased from 28-38 to 35-40
- Booboo can no longer deal any damage to heroes or structures when he is out of range (too far from Wildsoul)
- Booboo now has a visual indicator for when he's too far from Wildsoul
- HP Regeneration increased from 2 to 5
- Armor from 3/4/5/6 to a static 5
- Movement speed from 320/320/330/340 to a static 330
- Attack cooldown from 1750/1650/1550/1450 to a static 1500
* Above changes are meant to remove any hidden bonuses on the bear and put an accent on leveling the skill to gain extra abilities on Booboo.

Booboo's Abilities
Level 1
- Return (Q)
* 5 second cooldown
* On use Teleports Booboo to Wildsoul's position
* Goes on a 3-second cooldown when any player-controlled unit hits Booboo

- Alpha Male (E)
- Reworked
- Grants 50% extra attack damage vs. creeps

Level 2
- Swipe (W)
- Reworked
* 6-second cooldown
* Deals 150 Physical damage in a 300 radius and applies a 75% slow for 1 second
* This ability is used automatically on the 3rd attack when off cooldown.

Level 3
- Frenzy (R)
- Reworked
* Gives 2 attack damage for 15 seconds every time Booboo takes damage
* Max of 40 damage (20 charges)
* Works from transferred damage

Level 4
- Boosts all the other abilities
* Alpha Male (E) gains an extra 25% attack damage bonus vs. heroes
* Swipe (W) now also deals damage to structures and gains 50 extra range
* Frenzy (R) now passively gives 5 normal and magic armor
* Wildsoul gains this 5 extra normal and magic armor as well when in bear form (for a total of 10/15/20 +5)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zephyr
+ Zephyr is a strong hero who just doesn't fit in the current metagame. However, this change is aimed at allowing players the option of jungling at level 1.

Cyclones (W)
- Consuming a cyclone no longer interrupts your attack animation

Wind Shield (E)
- Now passively blocks 15 damage from creeps and neutrals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Item Balance ==

New Item: Merrick's Bounty
+ A new item to the game that allows supports and suicides the chance to catch up, even while getting dominated in the laning phase. We will be watching this item closely, but the days of supports having almost no income are over!
- Cost: 250 gold
- Available in Supplies and Outpost shops
- Buying or picking up the item starts a 30-second cooldown
- While off cooldown the item gains a charge every 10 seconds
- When you kill an enemy non-hero unit all of the charges are instantly consumed, giving you 10 gold per charge and starting a 30-second cooldown
- You cannot gain charges while dead
- Max of 120 charges
- Each time a charge is added, a sound plays for the player who owns the item

Blessed Orb
+ This was removed from the Outpost to make room for Merrick's Bounty. If we left in the Blessed Orb you would have to scroll down to purchase it, and no one wants to scroll at the Outpost!
- Removed from Outpost

Blood Chalice
+ Now rewards players with a potential boost of mana when any nearby enemy hero dies, even if Blood Chalice was not used. This helps Chalice remain a strong item pickup throughout the game.
- Radius for health refund increased from 700 to 1000
- Now gains 1 charge when an enemy hero within 1000 range of you dies
* Cannot gain a charge while Blood Chalice is on cooldown
- On use, will not remove health if you have a charge on the item
* Removes the charge on use 

Doom Bringer
+ Players will no longer be able to exploit the system and use neutrals to drop Doom Bringers for other players. Doom Bringer has also received a fun change: it increases in power when you get kills!
- Only drops when a player scores a kill against them
- Every hero kill made with the Doom Bringer grants a bonus 10 Attack Damage on the Doom Bringer
* This bonus Attack Damage remains on the item even if dropped
* Max of 25 charges

Lex Talionis
+ Lex Talionis having 0 mana cost was being abused on the courier and this will fix that abuse. Self-buff no longer stacking was removed to fix Parasite getting the buff twice.

New Limited Edition Shadowblade Avatar: Dominion

New Limited Edition Oogie Avatar: Boogie Oogie

New 8-Bit Gravekeeper Avatar: Pixelkeeper
- What happens to all the minions, creeps, and baddies who sacrifice themselves so the heroes of Arcadia can level-up? Their scattered bits and pieces are lovingly collected and restored by the Pixelkeeper, who believes there is a legendary warrior within every minor enemy and all they need is a chance to prove their skills are equal to their ambitions. Maybe it will happen this time...Okay, let's try again...

New 8-Bit Rhapsody Avatar: DDRhapsody
- DDRhapsody is the reigning dance champion of Arcadia, and as soon as she saw the carnage and chaos of Newerth she immediately started a campaign to replace all combat with dance battles. She was beating Gauntlet soundly when he blasted her off the platform with a catastrophic fist, and now she's going to freestyle across the battlefield and dance on the enemy's graves. Perfect!!
- DDRhapsody has a unique spawn sound the first time she enters the map. Each time she respawns a sound will play. Owning the Staff of The Master grants you a new ability 4 song.

= A.R.M.S. =

New A.R.M.S. Predator Avatar: Savior Predator
- The Predators were suspicious of the shiny, noisy Advanced Robotic Mobile Suits and what benefit they might serve when bone claws, spikes, and a stone hide had worked so well against man, and now daemon. Then the Engineers showed them what a captured Hellbourne Invader suit was capable of -- slicing through tooth, claw, and stone with ease -- and the Predators knew they would have to do what they've always done: adapt, evolve, and kill everything in front of them.

= General =

New Base Riptide Model
- Riptide's base has been changed from a lumbering elemental creature of the deep to a beautiful merwoman with a monstrous secret. 
- New Riptide lore: There are few sailors of the Hollow Sea brave or non-superstitious enough to whisper of The Maw, the deepest oceanic trench upon Newerth's scarred landscape. Those who can muster the courage to mention it speak only myth and rumor, for any vessel unlucky enough to actually gaze into the churning abyss is pulled to its black depths forever...or until The Maw decides to regurgitate them, the living drowned, twisted and deformed by the crushing pressure and insidious consciousness of the void.
The creature known as Riptide was the finest captain of the Legion's Armada, and any who questioned her ability due to gender would find it hard to continue their insults with a slit throat. Her ship, The Mermaid's Wrath, was sailing upon calm waters when the sea began to swirl and churn. The Maw was hungry. The Mermaid's Wrath and her entire crew were lost to the whirlpool, and as soon as the top castle disappeared the waters returned to serenity. But below the surface, these fine sailors and their captain were just beginning the endless torture of The Maw. Their lungs were filled with its icy waters, which had a terrible, undeniable consciousness, and their bodies were broken, battered, and reformed in the undertow. When the Second Corruption occurred and all of Newerth shook, The Maw released Riptide to serve as a protector of the deep, imbued with additional strength whenever she feels the cold comfort of water, and to deliver the most skilled warriors of Newerth back to the abyss. If the shape-shifting Riptide is any indication of what will become of them, it is best for everyone to stay out of the river.

== New Content ==

New 8-Bit Puppet Master Avatar: Game Master
- The electronic realm of Arcadia has been sealed away from the passage of time for decades due to a defensive shield coded by the Quarter Masters. This shield has kept them isolated and safe from the chaos of Newerth, but 8-Bit Kane accidentally sliced through the power cord during his headstrong rush through the shield to join the fray. Now all the characters of Arcadia are free to roam Newerth while the Quarter Masters duct-tape the cord, jostle consoles and blow into cartridges in a frantic attempt to reactivate the shield.
- Game Master is the #1 pro player in Arcadia, and all the 8-Bit characters queue up to be controlled by his peerless skills. Now that he's running free in Newerth, our heroes suddenly find themselves in the hands of a master gamer - but he rarely has their survival in mind, and he's keeping all the +1 lives for himself.

New 8-Bit Devourer Avatar: Paku Devo
- Paku Devo has been chomping at the bit to escape Arcadia and charge through the all-you-can-eat lanes of the Forest of Caldavar, gobbling up everything in sight. Now he has his chance, and even Lord Salforis's ghosts are running the other way.

New 8-Bit Courier: Owl Courier
- The wise 8-Bit owl courier knows the quickest route to deliver your pixels with no assembly required!

New Three Judges Accursed Avatar: Abaddon, Lord of Locusts
- Now that he has seen the abundant and thriving life upon Newerth, Abaddon brings forth from the Abyss an army of daemonic locusts, and as their lord and master he has donned his locust armor to lead them through the Forest of Caldavar, devouring and devastating all that teems with life. Some believe being blessed by Sol will save them from his wrath, but Abaddon cares not which god has smiled upon them.

New Swiftblade Avatar: Kissaki
- Even though the war of the Second Corruption rages on, devouring the young, green recruits of the Legion, the ShÃ o Temple high in the Sang-La Mountains refuses to expand their cadet program beyond the chosen few prodigies with the physical and spiritual requirements to survive the training. If the Temple accepted more recruits with lesser skills, they would simply die before they faced the Hellbourne; if the ShÃ o monks lowered their standards, the cadets would no longer be worth fifty warriors when they finally stepped foot on the battlefield.
- Cadet Kissaki is the example the monks provided when the Legion recruiters travel from Adkarna to demand higher numbers. They sent her to the front lines with the recruiters, and when she decimated an entire Hellbourne platoon without dulling her blades on armor or shields, the coterie from Adkarna issued a final order about the ShÃ o Temple: Leave the monks alone. They know what they're doing.

New A.R.M.S. Emerald Warden Avatar: Savior Emerald Warden
- The Savior suit constructed to fit the centaur-like Emerald Warden confused the Legion command; no record of the previous civilizations indicated they knew of the druidic beasts, or that the Wardens even existed in those times. But as soon as the dust had been cleaned from the joints and the suit was activated, Finian the Emerald Warden emerged from the thick forest to don the enhanced armor and weaponry, and his command of the robotic wolf and eagle was immediate and seamless. The Wardens are known for their secrets, and the Legion command hopes there is a good reason why the enigmatic creatures kept the existence of the Savior Advanced Robotic Mobile Suits to themselves until now.

Songkran Mid Wars Map
- Newerth celebrates the Thai New Year with an updated Mid Wars map! Enjoy these new features for a limited time only! 
- Songkran Fun & Games: Water Balloons & Trebuchets

* Boss area has been updated with new statues and props


New Songkran Mid Wars Boss: Songkranstein
- Transmutanstein is in full Songkran celebration mode and he's loaded up with water, clouds of white powder and flower petals to power-cleanse any bad spirits who wander into his festival site

Abilities
- Q: Sleeping Powder
* Songkranstein shoots a blast of colored powder into the air
* After a few seconds, the powder comes back down in an AOE around the boss
* Any unit caught in the AOE slows down, then falls asleep for 3 seconds
- W: Water Cannon
* Songkranstein sprays a blast of water toward a hero

- As the battle rages across Newerth, questers are continually finding new, lucrative opportunities!
* In this Cycle, complete your missions to earn an assortment of Gold and Silver as well as POG Soulstealer and this cycle's exclusive avatar, Minerva Silhouette
* This cycle's reward for those questers who top the leaderboard is the coveted Trophy Swiftblade

- New War Effort Silhouette Avatar: Minerva
* Nothing prepares you for combat on Newerth quite like being ripped out of your mother's womb (also your aunt's) and devoured by your father Jupiter, then springing out of his forehead holding a complete arsenal of weapons. With all of this considered, it makes complete sense that Minerva is the goddess of wisdom, arts, trade, and strategy. In the war between the Legion and Hellbourne she chooses to devote her artistic talents to carving up the enemy, loves to trade blades for kills, and most of her strategies revolve around stealing worshipers from her Greek counterpart Athena. The first chance she gets to snag that fluffy owl away from the daughter of Zeus, consider it grappled.
* Claim Minerva by opening the final chest in this cycle of the War Effort!

- New Gold Edition Songkran Engineer Avatar: Soaker Rosie
* Soaker Rosie is locked, loaded and ready to drench the battlefield with her arsenal of watery weapons. Her appetite for fun is infectious and she has everyone joining in the incredible festivities, but make no mistake, she is a killer shot with her blundersoaker and has no shortage of water balloons to hurl your way!

- New Songkran Magmus Avatar: Tidal Magmus
* With Songkran underway and festivities in full swing, the tide itself has come to join in the festivities. This colorful, hulking elemental has been drenching everyone and generally causing unadulterated fun. Help everyone cool down by letting out an eruption of water and wash those daemons away!

- New Songkran Riptide Avatar: Chalawan
* Chalawan is a terrifying and elusive creature due to its ability to shapeshift from a beautiful woman into a murderous creature. Seducing unsuspecting warriors and luring them down to the river for a swim, Chalawan transforms into a monstrous crocodile and her victims are never seen again. Be careful where you dip your toesâ€¦

- New 8-Bit Bubbles Avatar: Big Boss
* The electronic realm of Arcadia has been sealed away from the passage of time for decades due to a defensive shield coded by the Quarter Masters. This shield has kept them isolated and safe from the chaos of Newerth, but 8-Bit Kane accidentally sliced through the power cord during his headstrong rush through the shield to join the fray. Now all the characters of Arcadia are free to roam Newerth while the Quarter Masters duct-tape the cord, jostle consoles and blow into cartridges in a frantic attempt to reactivate the shield.
* As soon as the shield went down, Big Boss Bubbles erupted from his castle and continued his relentless pursuit of two goals: Marrying Aquarius, the heavenly body he believes is destined to be his bride, and ridding the world of plumbers. In a cruel twist of irony, Big Boss doesn't quite understand how HoN works and has no idea he'll never be in a game with another Bubbles avatar. But that won't stop him from hunting plumbers during his search, and he'll do his best to clog up pipes and flood the map to call these damned wrench-turners out of hiding.

- New 8-Bit Gunblade Avatar: LightGunblade
* There are only so many pixelated ducks, gangsters, and prison camp guards one can shoot before boredom sets in, so when the shield containing Arcadia collapsed LightGunblade coiled his cords, packed his guns and grappled his way into Newerth as quickly as possible. The plethora of new, challenging targets made his trigger fingers twitch with anticipation, and as soon as they pop up out of the weeds, consider them blasted. The same goes for that damned dog if he doesn't stop snickering.
* LightGunblade will say random taunt lines when getting hero kills and random lines of anger when respawning.

- New 8-Bit Ward: 8-Bit Ward
* This exclusive ward will keep a giant 8-Bit eye out for any dangerous pixels headed your way. Claim it by owning Big Boss Bubbles and LightGunblade!

- New 8-bit music added for the Caldavar map and its lobby: During the invasion of the Arcadians, the great Preserver of Songs noticed a lack of bleeps and bloops in the new land. With the power of circuitry and sound chips, the Preserver brought the tunes of Arcadia into Newerth.

- New A.R.M.S. Dampeer Avatar: Invader Dampeer
* Dampeer is not known for armor of any kind -- or clothes, for that matter -- so the Electrician was surprised when the life-sucking creature enlisted for the first wave of the Invader suits. His motivation was simple: if the Legion soldiers will be wearing armor impervious to his claws, how will he get to their blood and innards? The obvious solution is to don an enhanced weapon system just as powerful, with claws strong enough to open the Savior suits like cans of delicious gallantry.

- New POGs Avatar: Soulstealer
* These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- New Moon Queen Event Avatar: Gisele, Garena Star League Moon Queen
* Once a year the elite combatants of Newerth clash on the ultimate battlefield, the Garena Star League, and Gisele is tired of cheering from the booths! She carries the full power of the spectacular event with an arsenal of stars, lights, and lasers to dazzle the crowd and leave her enemies wishing they'd opted for the VIP access!

New Event Wards: Garena Star League Wards
- GSL Trophy Ward: A dazzling GSL star floating above the ultimate tournament trophy: the Doom Bringer! This ward will be available for purchase from the store
- Sync eSports: The electric Sync logo floating above a furious digital storm.
- Snoop Dog: The fierce DDog logo floating above a burning team banner.

- New Event Courier: Garena Star League Courier
* The last thing you need during the GSL 2015 tournament is delayed delivery of your items, and the GSL postman will make sure you get them ASAP!

- New Event Icon: Garena Star League Icon
* Show your support for GSL 2015 by rocking this account icon!

- New Gold Edition Witch Slayer Avatar: Sacrilege
* The elite Witch Slayer named Jonathan Wry embarked upon a mission to carry the purifying Sun Chalice to the Scar and pour its contents into the depths of the Underworld so Newerth could finally begin to heal. With each step closer to the Scar, Wry could feel the corruption taking root within his body, his soul. This mission would cost him his life, but sacrifice had always been prized by Sol's chosen. As he tipped the chalice toward the Scar, a beautiful woman with a dragon draped across her shoulders made him pause, made him doubt, and this was all the corruption needed to complete its infestation. Jonathan Wry became Sacrilege, and the Legion's greatest Witch Slayer now hunted his former brothers and sisters for Calamity's twisted version of Sol's prophecy.
* This Gold Edition avatar changes from pure to corrupted as you level up and features new effects for Graveyard, Power Drain, and Silver Bullet. In addition, any boots will give him glowing, corrupted footprints.

- New Drunken Master April Fool's Day Holiday Edition Avatar: Drunken Fool
* No matter what happens on the battlefield against the brutal, merciless Hellbourne, there is one man in Adkarna who never gets depressed. This may have something to do with the fact that he never gets sober, but we'll never know. The Drunken Fool is the full-time professional Jester of the Royal Family, but because Jeraziah hates fun and Ophelia rarely sets foot in the Capital, the Fool spends most of his time making sure the wine cellar does not gather cobwebs and honing his stage combat skills against the gilded mirrors throughout the castle. "How feeble and wobbly these enemies are! Have at you, bleruuughzzzzz..."

- New Thunderbringer Easter Holiday Edition Avatar: Fluffybringer
* Fluffybringer loves three things: Easter egg hunts, bad puns and electricity. This gives the annual festival in Newerth a bit of a 'shocking' twist and is sure to liven the mood for a while. Don't let his name or appearance fool you though; there is nothing fluffy and sweet about about him if he catches you stealing his eggs or cheating on the Easter egg hunt-he'll have no qualms steaming you like a cup of hot chocolate.

- New POGs Avatar: Legionnaire
* These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

10th March 2015

== General ==

New Game Mode: The Grimm Hunt
- The Grimm Hunt is the very first objective-based game mode in Heroes of Newerth!
- Played on Grimm's Crossing, players will be tasked with destroying magical Constructs that randomly spawn around the map.
- Each kill on Heroes or Constructs gives your team points. The first to 5000 points can win the game... if you can finish off the enemy's base!
- To facilitate more action-oriented gameplay, the next Construct's spawn point is revealed 10 seconds prior to its appearance; spawn points are also pinged on the minimap.

The Grimm Hunt: Construct Types
- Monument Constructs and Phantom Constructs
* Monument Constructs are immobile, but tread lightly; once you crack it open you'll be greeted by a slew of panicking Phantoms.
- Guardian Constructs
* These rotund Constructs are harmless until they reach half health. At this point, the wounded Guardian will become enraged and pounce on whoever is attacking it.
- Drone Constructs
* These Constructs are harmless â€“ but they have high evade skills due to their ability to hover over terrain. They're fast and squishy.

The Grimm Hunt: Kill Constructs â€“ Gear Up
- Each Construct carries a shop item. When a Construct is killed, its item drops into the inventory of a random player on the team that struck the final blow. If that player's inventory is full, the item goes into their stash.
- Items can be traded and/or shared with teammates, but not sold!
- Items can be picked up by the enemy team if dropped on the ground.
- The items held by Constructs are determined by different time intervals:
* The First Five Minutes: At the start of a match, Constructs hold items valued around 300-1,500 gold.
* Mid Game: After the five minute mark things really start to get interesting as Constructs begin to drop items valued around 1,500â€“4,500 gold.
* End Game: Party time! Once the game clock crosses ten minutes, items dropped by Constructs hold a high value! Ever wanted to try out a crazy item combination? The time is now! Frankly, in many instances you won't have much of a choice.

The Grimm Hunt: Additional Details
- The Bases in The Grimm Hunt are completely invulnerable at first. When one team reaches the score limit, their base will become vulnerable!
- The Grimm Hunt is a casual mode exclusive! We know you like the competitive aspect of HoN, but due to the hectic nature of The Grimm Hunt, it won't have a ranked option.
- Constructs will scale in power as the game progresses - you want the items in the end game? You're going to have to work for them!
- Outer towers have been removed! With so many things going on, the removal of towers will help create some breathing room.
- Heroes start at level 3 and with extra gold, so everyone can join the fight quickly!
- Everyone gains experience and gold passively as the game goes on.
- Respawn times are lowered significantly... until one team gets 5000 points, that is.

- New St. Patrick's Day Holiday Edition Klanx Avatar: Shamrock Klanx 
* Even though he isn't Irish, Klanx embraces the annual opportunity to cut loose and celebrate St. Patrick's Day by drinking too early and unleashing his minions to get into as many bar fights as possible. It's best to stay away from him for the entire holiday, because when the bar tab and the cops show up, he'll zip away and leave you hanging.

- New Limited Edition Zodiac Pearl Avatar: Aries
* Aries is the Zodiac's embodiment of enthusiasm, and in her constant search for new enterprises she has looked upon the endless war of Newerth and discovered a challenge too tempting to pass up: lifting the Legion and carrying them to safety over the cursed Hellbourne. Her eagerness is certainly appreciated, but she may soon find out the daemons will see her as just another sheep to fleece.

- New A.R.M.S. Solstice Avatar: Savior Solstice
* Even Solstice, the chosen warrior of the Moon Goddess Lunari, feels trepidation at the rapid evolution of the Hellbourne's weapons and brutality, and as a result she no longer feels completely safe in her true, nighttime form. The Savior suit offers a blessed solution, allowing her the protection of armor regardless of the hour. Her bond has been transferred to the daytime Savior armor, and now she uses the agile Stealth Savior armor for her nocturnal raids.

- New Bramble Avatar: Persian Manticore
* The Persian Manticore has witnessed her mate, the Manticore, devour Newerth heroes and beasts whole and leave no trace of their existence... and it looks like fun! She may toy with her prey a little longer than her male counterpart, but don't mistake that for an opportunity to escape. She welcomes another chance to stalk and pounce on you.

- New POGs Avatar: Keeper of the Forest
* These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- New War Effort Reward Avatar: Trophy Fayde

- New Ultimate Avatar: Blackwal Salforis
* When Maliken Grimm sent emissaries across Newerth uniting man under a single banner, he traveled in person to Lord Salforis in his mountain fortress of Blackwal. At that time, the Baron of Blackwal was considered one of the most powerful sorcerers and generals among men. He had not been seen upon a battlefield in years, and rumors spread he had discovered a magic that would end the wars of Man and Beast.
* What Maliken found within the fortress caused him and his men to seal it from the outside and pray it was never reopened. In his chambers, Salforis sat upon a throne of corpses in a room full of the dead, commanding them to rise. He cursed Maliken for allowing his unborn children to unleash the Hellbourne, rantings Maliken could not comprehend at the time.
* For decades, Salforis raved at his rotting corpses until the necromantic energies from the opening Scar filled him and empowered his sorcery. Now he ravages the battlefields, harvesting corpses and souls for his private army. What his plans are when that army grows large enough, only he knows.

Human Form (Level 1-6): This is Lord Salforis in his human form when he first began exploring the dark art of necromancy. The corruption has already taken seed within him, but he is still in control of his mind and soul.

His primary method will be to use his green wooden dragon staff, gifted to him by the World Tree, to generously unleash his positive energy and celebratory mood upon the enemy until he is at peace.

- New Courier: Sheep Courier (Chinese New Year 2/19 Promo item)
* Celebrate the Chinese New Year by delivering adorable fluffiness with this sheep courier!

- New Empath Avatar: Diao Chan
* The Sang-La Mountains have always produced legendary warriors, and with Calamity's attempt to begin the Third Corruption wreaking havoc throughout Newerth the ShÃ o Temple has sent the elite Guardians of the Monastery of the Way to help thwart this dire threat to Newerth.
* Diao Chan feels the tragic disharmony of Newerth, pushed to a critical level by the arrival of Calamity and the tortured souls of All Hells. She moves as one with her fellow Guardians of the Monastery of the Way, and woe be to the enemies who amass before her with the intent of harming her allies and home.

- New Nomad Avatar: Zhang Fei
* Zhang Feid keeps to himself while at the Monastery of the Way, meditating and contemplating his relationship with all things of the world. However, when the time for battle comes, he concentrates on the relationship of his blade with the skulls of his enemies. This relationship is always short and messy.

- New Holiday Edition Wretched Hag Avatar: Lady Sita
* Sita is the consort of Pra Ram, the hero of the Thai Ramakian epic myth. Pra Ram is the incarnation of the Hindu Deity Vishnu Narayan, born on Earth in order to punish the Demon Yaksa Tosagan and to fight for the return of Sita, who is esteemed as a paragon of spousal and feminine virtues for all Hindu women and is known for her dedication, self-sacrifice, courage and purity.
* After Pra Ram rescued her, Sita refused to leave the battle and chose instead to prove her courage and dedication to preserving the human race. She began by walking across burning coals to show she carried no impurities from her imprisonment, and when she emerged unharmed from the flames she knew she had a powerful weapon to use against the evil forces of Newerth.
* Note: This avatar has two versions, and purchasing one adds both to your account.
* English Voice: Lady Sita
* Thai Voice: Ramayana Sita

- New A.R.M.S. Avatar: Savior Rally
* The Savior Advanced Robotic Mobile Suits (or A.R.M.S.) were discovered in a sealed military bunker buried nearly a mile below the City of Iron, unearthed by the dwarves scraping every shred of ore from the endless tunnels and caverns. They seem to have been created by a previous civilization in a time of great conflict, designed to carry elite warriors into battle and protect them from harm while allowing them to carry weapons far beyond the capability of mere humans.
* Rally has always stood in the front ranks of the Legion's vanguard, and when the call came for volunteers to test the newly discovered Savior suits he stepped forward without hesitation. If these A.R.M.S. will aid in the war against the Hellbourne, this master of motivation will gladly be the shining example for others to follow.

New Feature: The War Effort
- The War Effort is a brand new feature designed to reward players for completing daily quests in Heroes of Newerth.

- Each day, quests will be available to complete for reputation points that are used to fill a player's War Effort satchel or chest. Once enough reputation points are accumulated to fill a satchel or chest, they can be exchanged for in-game content. 
- Each quest completed will also be recorded on a monthly leaderboard. Those who complete the most quests at the end of each War Effort cycle will receive additional rewards. 
- There's a variety of loot to be earned for those who support The War Effort. Each cycle, a combination of up to 14 satchels and/or chests can be exchanged for content. 

- Those who earn enough reputation points to open the final chest will be rewarded with the Treasure of Champions (ToC), which is a War Effort exclusive piece of content. The first War Effort cycle's ToC will be Treasure Hunter Hag!
- The spoils of war don't stop there, though. For The War Efforts' biggest contributors, a golden opportunity awaits, as the top 25 questers will be rewarded with an illustrious Trophy Avatar. 
- Seriously, only 25 players will have access to these Trophy Avatars â€“ not even our staff can use them! Fayde will be the first Trophy Avatar up for grabs.

- But you don't need to be the very best to still secure some loot from the leaderboard; here's what you will receive if you are in the top 5000 questers for a cycle:

- Top 10 players:

== New Content ==

- New War Effort Avatar: Treasure Hunter Hag
* This wildly adventurous treasure hunter will not be satisfied until she has explored every uncharted area of Newerth for hidden riches, and even those areas assumed to be picked clean often relinquish long-lost fortunes to her relentless questing.
* She spends more time in the dark, wild areas of Newerth than the soft cities, and as a result she has more friends among the bats than people. These winged friends flock to her familiar torch, guide her through treacherous territory and protect her from those who would steal her hard-won treasures.

- New Blackwal Avatars
* The Legion have no dead to bury. This is not because they are winning the war, or lose no warriors to the Hellbourne's blades and claws-it is because Lord Salforis and his Carrion Harvesters are gathering the dead and hauling them back to the grisly depths of Blackwal, where Salforis performs his abhorrent rituals to reanimate the corpses to raise his personal army of the dead.

- New Blackwal Pyromancer Avatar: Brimstone
* Brimstone Pyromancer is an affront to the Sacred Order, the men and women whose complete devotion to Sol grants them power over the miracle of flame. His blessed spirit had ascended to the afterlife, but once his body was reanimated by Salforis' fell sorcery his soul was dragged into Purgatory to witness his former vessel commit acts of merciless depravity as he spews Hellfire: corrupted flames that consume the soul and flesh alike.

- New Blackwal Engineer Avatar: Mangler
* Lord Salforis has long experimented with necromancy and reanimation, but the fragility of dead flesh always has confounded him. When his Carrion Harvesters brought him the corpse of a Legion Engineer, the Baron of Blackwal saw an opportunity to augment his ranks of the undead with machinery that cannot be killed. The corrupted Mangler was born within the tombs of Blackwal, and the Legion will wish he'd stayed there.

- New Gold Edition Blackwal Kinesis Avatar: Necrosis
* Any sorcerer who feels drawn to the insidious necromantic arts and wants to learn from the master will eventually make the pilgrimage to Blackwal, where they will thrive or perish. Others, like Necrosis, will have their unwilling corpses dragged from the battlefield by the Carrion Harvesters and dumped into the Tombs of Travail, where they will awaken to an agonizing new existence that is neither life nor death. Necrosis had once been a Disciple of the Way, harnessing the energy of life that flows through all things, but Salforis has shown him the undercurrent beneath that flow -- the undertow of death and decay -- that is quickly rising to the surface of Newerth. Necrosis embraced it like a maggot feeding on dead flesh, and now he carries the power of dead against his former brothers in arms.

- New Blackwal Tarot Avatar: Death Dealer
* When Lord Salforis learned that the nomadic tribes which sometimes skirted along the fringe of Blackwal had a chosen few who could see the future, he ordered his Carrion Harvesters to scour the realm until they found one. His shambling soldiers did as he asked and dragged the terrified woman before the Baron of Blackwal, who demanded the oracle tell him if he would live forever. The poor gypsy was confounded. It felt as though her own life was being stolen in the presence of Salforis, and every whisper from her divination told her the hulking brute of a man was already dead. When she finally found her voice and courage and said as much, Salforis was so enraged he called forth the grasping hands of his Undying. They tore at the oracle's flesh and soul, but Salforis would not let them pull the life from her completely until she told him what she saw when she sought the manner of her own death. Only when she screamed â€œThis! Here!â€ did he grant her death, though it was a brief respite, for he immediately reanimated her corpse to serve as his personal soothsayer of doom.

- New A.R.M.S. Hammerstorm Avatar: Savior Hammerstorm
* The Savior Advanced Robotic Mobile Suits (or A.R.M.S.) were discovered in a sealed military bunker buried nearly a mile below the City of Iron, unearthed by the dwarves scraping every shred of ore from the endless tunnels and caverns. They seem to have been created by a previous civilization in a time of great conflict, designed to carry elite warriors into battle and protect them from harm while allowing them to carry weapons far beyond the capability of mere humans.
Even Hammerstorm knows there is one thing stronger than the hammer -- the forge. By wrapping himself in the mysterious metallic armor found beneath the City of Iron, he constructs a new, impervious version of the famed, stoic warrior. And the suit lets him carry a bigger hammer, so forget the other stuff.

- New Tempest Skin: Golden Poseidon
* Poseidon is ready to take his rightful place ahead of Hades and Zeus, and when that's done he'll challenge Athena for the role of official protector of her beloved Athens (if he can find the blasted placeâ€¦). In preparation for these lofty positions, the God of the Sea has assembled a dazzling suit of golden armor from the endless treasures offered to him via the sunken ships strewn across his ocean floor. It's so kind of his worshipers to sail during his tantrums -- breaking ships into splinters always seems to cheer him up.

- New POGs Avatar: Jeraziah
* These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- New Ward Skin: Cassie Calamity
* Those glasses might just be a fashion accessory, but this flapping stuffed dragon ward skin will certainly help your team see better!

Insanitarius
- Fixed Insanitarius' cooldown incorrectly resetting back to 5 seconds if toggled off on the same frame it would normally go off cooldown

Shrunken Head

Version 3.6.1

14th January 2015

- With wishful thinking for a short winter, we are reverting all maps from holiday/winter themes back to their standard themes with this patch

== New Content ==

- New Limited Edition Zodiac Bubbles Avatar: Aquarius
* Throughout history, Aquarius has been both revered for providing water for parched crops and cursed for her destructive floods. Those floods, if the the victims were completely honest with themselves, were celestial payback for their own foul actions. With Newerth in constant turmoil and the deeds of the Legion and Hellbourne threatening to stain the soil for all time, Aquarius has descended from the heavens to pour her endless, cleansing water upon the bloody, torn earth and its citizens. It's bath time daemons, whether you like it or not.
 
- New Vindicator Avatar: Vindi the Gray
* While many rely on steel and strength to bring war to the Hellbourne, the few remaining true wizards know that victory lies in adding a dash of sorcery and pipeweed here and there to counter the fell darkness wrought by the daemons and corrupted men. Vindi the Gray has used these time and again in his effort to assemble a fellowship of five who can work together without griefing or abandoning their key posts, but such a brotherhood is rare indeed...

- New Plague Rider Avatar: Eagle Rider
* Hooray! The Eagle Riders swoop in at the last minute to fend off the winged Hellbourne daemons who have harassed and slaughtered Legion soldiers for years! As the Eagle Riders battle and chase the flying fiends away, some of the relieved soldiers are overheard asking why in the name of Sol these bird pilots waited so long to join the fray. Oh well, they're here now!

- New Rampage Avatar: White Orc
* While most Hellbourne warriors will gladly kill any Legion scum they encounter, the White Orcs of Krula, storming down the slopes atop their slavering, monstrous hyenas, have a special affinity for slaughtering the halfling warriors who dwell in the mountain forests surrounding the City of Iron. The two races share a long, lethal history of mountainous territory taken, reclaimed, and lost again to each other and the blood feud runs deep through the veins of both sides. The bravest halflings try to use this against the White Orcs, baiting them so fellow Legion soldiers can flank and kill the myopic riders, but unfortunately this has mainly resulted in a shortage of brave halflings.

- New Wildsoul Avatar: Northman Werebear 
* The Northman Werebear is a legend among Legion troops, a shape-shifting wildman whose entire race has been slaughtered by the Hellbourne. He now protects his parcel of the Forest of Caldavar with his ever-present wood ax-and if that doesn't work, he'll summon his beloved pet bear to chase down and shred any trespassers. As for those who defy the ax and outwit the bear, the legend says, they get to face the savage Northman in his transformed state, a two-legged bear with the instinct of a primal beast and the vengeance of a broken hearted man.

- New Scout Avatar: Halfling Warrior
* The secretive halfling warriors dwell in the remote mountain forests surrounding the City of Iron, and very few have been glimpsed since the beginning of the Second Corruption. They chose to withdraw further into their enclaves rather than join the battle, but the ever-encroaching Hellbourne, the arrival of Calamity and Sunder to possibly begin the Third Corruption, and the constant harrying from the White Orcs of Krula have compelled the bravest of these halfling warriors to venture forth and do what they can to bring peace to Newerth.

- New A.R.M.S. Pebbles Avatar: Savior Pebbles
* The Savior Advanced Robotic Mobile Suits (or A.R.M.S.) were discovered in a sealed military bunker buried nearly a mile below the City of Iron, unearthed by the dwarves scraping every shred of ore from the endless tunnels and caverns. They seem to have been created by a previous civilization in a time of great conflict, designed to carry elite warriors into battle and protect them from harm while allowing them to carry weapons far beyond the capability of mere humans.
As Newerth continues to be torn apart by the Second Corruption, some of the Elementals find their link to the planet a hindrance, distracting them from the battle, and so they sever the bond and fight without the constant pain of their homeland echoing within their soul. Pebbles is not one of these Elementals. He knows that pain is a burden of honor and a necessary agony if he is to commit the violence required to defeat the daemons. But still, he is weakened by Newerth's suffering, and so he welcomes the Savior suit and its augmented combat capabilities, because it brings him closer to ending the war and returning to his peaceful state.

- New POGs Avatars: Ophelia and Defiler
* These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

HoN 3.6 - Calamity's Corruption
-------------
17th December 2014

+ With the last patch's enhancements to carry players and farming in general, this followup patch is centered around bringing the supports up as well. Supports have always had a hard time in HoN with gold and gaining the levels needed to remain relevant, and a lot of changes in this patch are geared towards answering that. 

+ Another situation that arose over the past six months is that certain supports have stayed in the limelight too long. We want to bring more top pick supports to the pool to add a more diverse choices when picking what support you want for your lineup.

+ With cheaper support items and overall power increases to a lot of supports in the game, we hope to see our support players having an easier time acquiring the farm and levels to succeed. 

+ Supports aren't the only thing that has changed in this patch. A lot of under utilized heroes are seeing some solid power increase and some more annoying problems are being taken care of.


== New Hero ==

New Hellbourne Agility Hero: Calamity
- And the Codex Solaris states:
* When the boy king falls from grace his tainted soul will be judged by The Three, and he shall be lost forever behind the calamitous Sunder, the great horror who traps all condemned souls within the endless Hells with his vast wings. And so begins the Third Corruption.
* Sister Arete of the Sacred Order believed Sol had set her upon a path to be King Jeraziah's Queen and provide him with an heir. She knew the King was struggling to counter the brutality of the Hellbourne's dark magic, so she hid herself in the catacombs below the Cathedral of Arasunia and devoted her studies to the black arts until she was expert, able to consult Jeraziah on the daemonic forces that were turning his armies into corpses and dust.
* When Sister Arete finally musters the courage to forsake her vows of the Sacred Order and present herself to the King, Jeraziah accuses her of being a daemon herself, trying to tempt him into the sin that would cast his soul down to be judged by The Three Judges of All Hells: Minos, Abaddon, and Aeacus, and forever imprisoned by the dragon guardian Sunder.
* Sister Arete is expulsed from the Sacred Order and exiled from Arasunia, but her months spent with the dark arts have twisted her mind and spirit into believing she will stand beside Jeraziah whether he likes it or not, and she has a plan to do so. She bursts back into the Cathedral and gorges on poison on the altar, killing herself and sending her soul to be weighed by The Three Judges, who condemn her to an eternity of wearing a crown of corpses and being burned alive by Hellfire.
* This is what Sister Arete wants.
* She is sent to face Sunder, who hoards the souls within the Vault of All Hells, and she uses her powers to make the fearsome guardian her pet. Now she has become Calamity, breaking open the doors of hell and unleashing an endless stream of tortured souls upon Newerth. But she cares not about this - she will kill every one of Jeraziah's soldiers until only he is left standing, and then she will stand beside him, ruling the Third Corruption together.

Abilities
- Ability 1: Firebomb
* Target a location to throw a Flaming Orb, dealing 40/80/120/160 Magic Damage
* The Orb bounces at that spot 4 more times, dealing 15/25/35/45 Magic Damage and pulling enemies towards it

- Ability 2: Dragon's Path
* Passively creates 3 Dragons rotating around Calamity that deal 22/44/66/88 Magic Damage when they touch someone
* Grants 2 sub-abilities to move the Dragons towards or away from yourself

- Ability 3: Funeral Pyre
* Passively deals an extra Attack to any target you deal damage to when off cooldown
* Heroes have 1 of all Stats and 3 Movement Speed drained, giving you the Movement Speed and 3 Agility for 30/60/90/120 seconds

- Ability 4: Sunder's Vault
* Target an area to create a circular wall
* Once the wall is complete, enemies inside take up to 420/560/700 Magic Damage, with more dealt to those in the center
* Staff of the Master: Increases cast range to Global and lowers the cooldown to 80 seconds

New Calamity Alt Avatar: Wynd
- Born with the mark of the sky, the princess of the plains knew from the time she could understand the tales her mother told her that she was destined for greatness. The mark had not been seen since the time of her grandfather's grandfather and it spoke of a great destiny for the one who bore it. When she was just a child she first summoned up the essence of the North. It was just a gust then, not even a breeze, but it became her companion, constantly at her side.
- Now she has grown into the princess that she was meant to be, but has no people over which to rule-the waves of daemons have seen to that. Hearing of a greater battle in the forests to the east she has taken the journey there to aid the warriors in driving the daemons back to the Scar from which they emerged. She has taken the name of those she commands as her own and as Wynd she will ensure that no others fall to the Hellbourne scourge. This is what she was born for, this is what it means to bear the mark of the storm... a life in twisting turmoil and unleashing the fury of the sky spirits on the enemies of the land.

New Calamity Debut Avatar: Cassie Calamity and Stuffed Sunder
- Cassie was always fascinated by video games in general and HoN in particular. When she saw the leaked images of the upcoming hero she just knew she had to put together her next amazing Cosplay. Unfortunately all she had to go on were some rough shots of that amazing dragon, so she just improvised from there. When she showed up at the convention with a massive stuffed dragon around her neck and a trio of stuffed baby dragons spinning around her on strings, the rest of the community was impressed with her ingenuity, even if they had no idea what she was doing. Their ignorance (they thought she was a champion!) enraged her and made her even more crazed to prove that she is the best Cosplayer out there.

New Calamity-Themed Ward Skins
- Calamity Ward Skin
* A seething dragon scanning the horizon from atop a pillar of hell!


== Hero Balance ==

Accursed
+ Faster cast speeds help Accursed to properly fulfill his niche of making clutch shields and heals.
- Cauterize: Cast action time decreased from 500ms to 300ms
- Fire Shield: Cast action time decreased from 500ms to 150ms

Andromeda
+ We wanted to bring her ganking more into focus and allow her to compete with more of the Intelligence-based supports by giving her more casts of her comet. This will make her more of a threat in lane and all around roaming
- Comet: Mana cost reduced from 105/115/125/135 to 70/80/90/100

Arachna 
+ Arachna is already only putting one point into this in the early game and the Magic Armor itself scales nicely so giving this a 5 second at all levels helps Arachna's defense during the early portions of the game.
- Harden Carapace: Duration rescaled from 2/3/4/5 to 5 seconds at all ranks

Armadon
+ Armadon got a slight tweak to his stats allowing more spine spam. 
- Base Intelligence increased from 14 to 15
- Agility gain increased from 1.8 to 1.9

Blacksmith
+ Some much needed tweaks to Frenzy, which will give Blacksmith a bit more utility
- Frenzy: Cast Speed increased from 7/14/21/28 to 30 at all ranks
- Frenzy: Mana cost decreased from 75 to 50

Blitz
+ A change in the charge system to make the damage done consistently rather than in 1 second chunks
- Quicken: Cast Time removed
- Pilfering: Movement Speed steal from 15/25/35/45 to 3/5/7/9 per charge
- Pilfering: Maximum charges from 5 to 25
- Pilfering: Time between procs from 1 to 0.2 seconds
* Decay time for loss of charges also rescaled properly to fit new mechanics while maintaining the same timepoint benchmarks as before

Bombardier
+ A small increase in the touch radius of Sticky Bomb will make this hero a bit more approachable for players.
- Sticky Bomb: Increase touch radius of Sticky Bomb from 100 to 125

Bramble 
+ Vine Wall is Bramble's bread and butter ability. Since Vine Wall was no longer refreshed by Restoration Stone, a cooldown decrease was warranted.
- Vine Wall: Cooldown decreased from 90/80/70 to 80/70/60 seconds

Circe
+ The entire hero revolves around getting off her ultimate and these changes are directed at helping her do so.
- Twisted Visage: Cooldown decreased from 120/100/80 to 100/80/60 seconds
- Twisted Visage: Increased cast range from 700 to 750

Corrupted Disciple
+ Same as Blitz, we want the charge application to be smooth over time rather than one second chunks.
- Corrupted Conduit: Damage steal from 5/10/15/20 to 1/2/3/4 per charge
- Corrupted Conduit: Maximum charges from 10 to 50
- Corrupted Conduit: Time between procs from 1 to 0.2 seconds

Cthulhuphant
+ Cthulhuphant had proven to be too frustrating to deal with and very easily disrupted teams with almost no effort. These nerfs will put Cthulhuphant in more of a skilled disruption role and become less annoying to play against.
- Hook Em: Increased damage to heroes removed; now does 15/20/25/30 Magic Damage to all enemy units for each pulse
- Dream of Madness: Cooldown increased from 32/30/28/26 to 40/35/30/25 seconds
- Dream of Madness: Insanity aura now applies in a 180 degree arc in front of Cthulhuphant, rather than applying 360 degrees around him
- Dream of Madness: Both the radius of the Insanity cone and the search radius for someone to attack when you go insane are set to 1000 units now

Deadwood
+ Although the numbers for Deadwood after his changes were still there and the later portions of the game even stronger than before in certain situations, we have heard your cries for aid. The following changes are aimed at bringing Deadwood back to his previous levels of enjoyment, especially at level 6, while maintaining a more anti-strength niche.
- Uproot/Oakbolt: Now deals damage equal to your Attack Damage when thrown. Will now apply Oakbolt's Movement Speed Slow effect on the final attack
- Willowmaker: Increased Physical Damage from 225/450/725 to 250/475/725 and increased the strength reduction from 30% to 35%

Demented Shaman
+ Some consistency was needed across the board and small tweaks to keep him relevant with some of the other supports out there.
- Armor increased by 0.5
- Entangle: Now slows for 2 seconds at all levels
- Entangle: Now stuns for 0/0.5/1/1.5 seconds instead of 0/0/1/1 seconds after the slow state expires

Flint Beastwood
+ More utility and more area denial to enhance that play-style which is overlooked a lot.
- Explosive Flare: Increased duration from 4 to 6 seconds

Geomancer
+ This change allows Geomancer to set up ganks and better utilize his mobility.
- Dig: Range Increased from 1000 to 1250

Gladiator
+ Gladiator's abilities have always been hard to land and learn. Since the game is constantly changing, we felt it was needed to improve some of the feel and use of his abilities.
- Showdown: Range increased from 500/650/800/950 to 650/750/850/950
- Pitfall: Radius increased from 225 to 250

Gravekeeper
+ The ultimate was on way too long of a cooldown at level 6 and too short of a cooldown at level 16.
- Zombie Apocalypse: Cooldown rescaled from 140/100/60 to 100/85/70 seconds

Grinex 
+ A small improvement to Grinex which we are still keeping a close eye on.
- Agility gain increased from 1.8 to 2.0 

Lodestone
+ Lodestone is a high-impact hero that has the potential for huge swings. Some of our previous nerfs made him fall out of sight in most all levels of play. These changes are meant to tweak his capabilities as a suicide and make his Drill more reliable, which will make his combo easier to obtain.
- Rocket Drill: Projectile impact time decreased from 600ms to 400ms
- Lodestone Plates: Charge refresh time decreased from 9/8/7/6 to 6 seconds at all levels

Magebane
+ The unique modifier that does not allow Magebane to use Nullfire Blade has been removed because it was an unnecessary limitation from a time long past. Magebane finally has a viable early/mid-game offensive item option!
- Mana Combustion: Modifier has been removed from the game

Maliken
+ This is simply a consistency change.
- Hellbourne Zeal: Attack Speed scaling from 0.5/0.8/1.2/1.4 to 0.5/0.8/1.1/1.4

Master of Arms
+ Blast Shot was doing too little damage earlier on and needed some better scaling.
- Blast Shot: Magic Damage increased from 70/130/190/250 to 85/140/195/250

Martyr
+ Martyr has always had the problem of not really knowing if he wanted to be high health or low health. His abilities were giving him several mixed signals and this rework hopes to clear the air significantly. Hand in Hand before could really only be used to save an ally if Martyr was high health... which made Retribution terrible in terms of damage. Now, Hand in Hand can be used offensively and staying low health doesn't diminish your ability to save an ally with the new Guardian Angel. Finally, Sol's Conviction gives Martyr the amazing health manipulation tool he needs to be effective at all stages of a fight.

- Retribution: Damage is now dealt in a 250 radius around the target
- Retribution: Maximum Damage decreased from 550 to 420 Magic Damage
- Retribution: Slow duration decreased from 3s to 2.5s

- Guardian Angel: Reworked
- Guardian Angel: Grants 55/70/85/100% Damage Reduction to the target for 5 seconds. After the effect ends, the target immediately takes all of the damage prevented as non-lethal Superior Magic Damage.
- Guardian Angel: 800 range
- Guardian Angel: 23/20/17/14 second cooldown
- Guardian Angel: Can be double activated to cast on yourself

- Sol's Conviction: Reworked
- Sol's Conviction: Now grants up to 4/8/12/16 Health Regeneration as you get lower life
- Sol's Conviction: On use, now swaps your current Health and Mana percentages over 6/5/4/3 seconds
- Sol's Conviction: 45 second Cooldown

- Hand in Hand: Can now be cast on Enemy Heroes to lower both of your health pools to the lower of the two. Can lower an Enemy's health to a minimum of 40/30/20% of their maximum.
* Hand in Hand: Can still be cast on Allies for the same effect it currently has
- Hand in Hand: Staff of the Master still heals both yourself and an Ally to full health. Now also removes the minimum cap for lowering Enemy health and Immobilizes any enemy Hero you cast on for the duration of the channel.

Midas
+ Midas has one of the coolest playstyles in HoN. However, he lacks a solid payoff for a well executed combo. These changes are geared towards increasing that payoff and allowing him a bit more utility across the board.
- Base Armor increased from 2.2 to 3.0
- Attack Damage increased from 45-51 to 48-54
- Lion's Pride: Range increased from 800 to 1000
- Lion's Pride: Projectile speed increased from 850 to 1000
- Lion's Pride: Cooldown decreased from 13 to 12 seconds
- Golden Salvo: Cooldown decreased from 18 to 16 seconds
- Elemental Warp: Cooldown decreased from 17 to 15 seconds
- Transmute: Now applies a debuff to enemies that allows Midas to deal an extra 40/80/120 Attack Damage per autoattack for the next 3 seconds
- Transmute: Cooldown reduction on all skills from 2/4/6 seconds to 2/3/4 seconds

Moira
+ Moira had some minor issues we wanted to address. Ephemeral Forge was not nearly effective enough given the cost, so we made the first few seconds impossible for the illusion to die. This should let her be able to reach the effectiveness that we wanted initially. Arcane Vortex also had a very long cast time, which when combined with being a very small ground target spell, led to many frustrating situations. These additional changes should make it slightly easier to land.
- Shards of Harkon: Will now hit units in fog
* Will not hit stealthed units unless they are revealed
- Ephemeral Forge: Spirit is now invulnerable during the first 2 seconds of the spell's channel (in addition to being disabled)
- Arcane Vortex: Cast action time decreased from 400ms to 200ms
- Arcane Vortex: Initial radius increased from 125 to 150

Monarch
+ This rework is meant to finally put Monarch in a different role and niche than Glacius. There was often discussion about their overlapping roles and we wanted to come up with something unique to make it happen. Monarch now fills the counter-initiation and heavy defense role fantastically well. She is now the only support in the game who gets free wards, which can help her save up some money for bigger items. She retains a lot of her old utility, but now she truly can save a teammate who is on the brink of death and make sure vision on the map is always secured.

- Starting Movement Speed changed from 295 to 300

- Crippling Pollen: Damage increased from 70 to 70/80/90/100 at all levels
- Crippling Pollen: Projectile speed increased from 800 to 1000

- Chrysalis: Now reduces damage by 20/40/60/80%
- Chrysalis: Mana cost is 100 at all levels
- Chrysalis: Now instantly heals 75 HP and another 20/30/40/50 HP per second over 3 seconds

- Noxious Cloud: Removed
- New Ability: Noxious Nightcrawler
- Noxious Nightcrawler: Target a location to send a Noxious Nightcrawler there. While travelling to its location, the Noxious Nightcrawler can be killed in 1 hit. Once it gets there, it will go invisible and grant vision around itself similar to a Ward of Sight for 6 minutes
- Noxious Nightcrawler: If an enemy comes within 250 units of the invisible stationary Noxious Nightcrawler, the Nightcrawler explodes into a Noxious Cloud
- Noxious Nightcrawler: Nightcrawler travels at 1000 Movement Speed for the first 600 units travelled. After this point, its Movement Speed will rapidly decay
+ The intention of this is to preserve the offensive capabilities of Noxious Cloud as much as possible.
- 1500 Cast Range
- 50 Mana Cost
- 30 second Cooldown

- Cleansing Wind: Movement Speed bonus rescaled from 80/140/200 to 100/150/200

Nymphora
+ Nymphora's heal was slightly hard to use even with good communication and the numbers were a bit low for what we wanted her to accomplish out of the laning phase. These small tweaks will enhance the use and allow for a better mid game transition.
- Volatile Pod: Heal and Magic Damage increased from 60/120/180/240 to 75/135/195/255
- Volatile Pod: Increased radius from 250 to 300

Parasite
+ After watching Parasite with the recent changes, we found that the level 4 HP regeneration was just too frustrating overall, thus we have changed it to the following:
- Infest: Health Drain Per Second changed from 3/1.5/0/-1.5 to 3/2/1/0%

Pharaoh
+ The mana drain was pretty unnoticeable and it needed some love. This change will help Pharaoh during the laning phase and make the mana burn be more of a threat than a novelty.
- Mana drain on walls increased from 55/70/85/100 to 65/90/115/140

Pollywog Priest
+ The overall mana costs compared to his total pool was deemed too high. These changes will allow Pollywog Priest to have more utility and options rather than a one-trick pony who would run away with no mana.
- Electric Jolt: Mana cost rescaled from 100/120/140/160 to 90/110/130/150
- Morph: Mana cost rescaled from 110/140/170/200 to 90/125/160/195
- Tongue Tied: Mana cost rescaled from 110/130/155/180 to 90/110/130/150

Plague Rider
+ Let's face it, putting one shield on an ally was super tedious. With this change, Plague Rider can also fill a nice pushing role by slamming down a shield on every creep in a wave.
- Cursed Shield: Now applies a shield in a 600 radius around the target to a max of 6 targets. This prioritizes heroes first
- Cursed Shield: Cooldown increased from 10 to 30 seconds
- Cursed Shield: Mana Cost increased from 25 to 75
- Plague Carrier: Cooldown rescaled from 145/115/60 to 140/100/60

Pyromancer
+ Some consistency tweaks to his mana costs.
- Dragonfire: Mana cost rescaled from 90/100/110/125 to 95/105/115/125
- Dragonfire: Magic Damage rescaled from 90/150/210/280 to 100/160/220/280

Ravenor
+ A simple change to make the ultimate less tedious to play with and does not increase the power level that dramatically.
- Power Overwhelming: Charges timer countdown increased from 8 seconds to 10 seconds

Scout
+ Scout has always been a great roamer/suicide and with Vanish giving more Movement Speed, it will enhance his ability to move throughout the map.
- Vanish: Bonus Movement Speed increased from 6/9/12/15% to 10/12/14/16%

Slither
+ Slither has an excellent skillset, but he was finding himself in the thick of danger due to his lack of Attack Range and range of his Poison Spray. With these changes, we feel that Slither will be a go-to hero for massive lane harassment and kill potential.
- Attack Range increased from 450 to 500
- Poison Spray: Range increased from 625/750/875/1000 to 700/800/900/1000

Swiftblade
+ Swiftblade has climbed to the top of our hero pool over the past six months in every region. The numbers took a small hit across the board to remove some of his killing power while remaining a competitive threat.
- Strength decreased from 20 to 18
- Blade Frenzy: Magic Damage per second decreased from 80/100/120/140 to 75/95/115/135
- Counter Attack: Proc chance decreased from 15/20/25/30% to 10/15/20/25%
- Way of the Sword: Critical Strike proc chance decreased from 12/20/28/36% to 10/18/26/34% 

Succubus
+ Smitten was underused and not very effective. This change should give her a reason to put points into the ability at any stage of the game based on the play-style she chooses.
- Smitten: Now reduces damage by 40% at all levels
- Smitten: Duration rescaled to 4/8/12/16 seconds

- Blast of Lightning: Allied buff rescaled from 75 to 60/75/90/105 bonus Movement Speed

- Terror Mound: Gold bounty increased from 25 to 35

== Item Balance ==

Alchemist's Bones
+ Alchemist's Bones has had a rough time in HoN, as it has always tried to fill a role of enhancing farm, mainly for jungle heroes. With these changes we will see jungle heroes receive more uses and the projectile being instant will stop those pesky Parasites from denying their creeps before you own them!!!
- Now grants 1.75 times XP upon killing target creep
- Instantly kills target creep
* Visual projectile now spawns from target creep and travels towards the Alchemist's Bones user

Assassin's Shroud
+ This change was aimed at giving the player more wiggle room in setting up ganks or positioning for a tradeoff on cool down.
- Duration increased from 9 to 11 seconds
- Cooldown increased from 18 to 20 seconds

Dust of Revelation
+ With the added anti-juke utility it gives in addition to the clearvision, an increase in cost was warranted.
- Cost increased from 180 to 200

Lex Talionis

- Now dispels debuff from self if the target dies early

Ioyn Stone

- Cost reduced from 250 to 200

Shield Breaker
+ A small buff added along with Shieldbreaker's previous buffs to put this item in a solid spot.

New Holiday Edition Maps, Bosses and Creeps
- Holiday Celebration in the Forest of Caldavar
- Frost Field Mid Wars
- Abominable Kongor in Forest of Caldavar
- Santa Slayer Mid Wars Boss
- Holiday Hat Creeps
- Santa Merrick and His Holiday Shop
- Holiday Plinko
- New Holiday Grab Bag/Gifting
- The Holidays are here and the goodies are abundant! Look for special holiday grab bags in store and get your goodies while they last
* The contents of these Grab Bags vary from region to region
- New Avatars

+ Historically, only offensive actions provided scoreboard credit and assist gold. The system design punished several interesting heroes who were most effective in reactive and defensive roles. We want to reward players for their performance, not be punished for their contributions; as such, all activated abilities, healing, and buffs on friendly targets who contribute to a kill, will also grant assist gold and scoreboard credit. Auras will not count as they are considered passive, not activated. #Martyr wings.
- Players now receive assist credit and assist gold for providing active buffs, abilities or healing to their friendly combatants.


Forests of Caldavar Jungle Changes
+ With a lot of jungle changes over the past months, we wanted to update everything in the jungle that was causing more frustration than fun. In doing so we hope to see pulling, stacking and other general jungle activities be less frustrating and more consistent.

+ This allows the player to kill the camp outside the 500 radius spawn-check zone like every other camp
- Chase distance increased from 300 to 650 for the Hellbourne easy camp
* Change still doesn't allow pulling the HB easy camp to lane

+ Enables more consistent stacking when pulling the camp out from different angles
- Centered the 500 radius spawn-check zones
* Will have a negligible difference on ward placements for blocking camps
* Will have a negligible difference in terms of creep stacking/pulling "feel"

+ Allows melee heroes to pull the camp without having a Hatchet
- Removed Antlore Necromancer camp only from the pull camps
* Removes the possibility that one team will get multiple Antlore Necromancer camps in the pull camp and gets a great advantage (by RNG) when it comes to denying creep waves


Neutral Creep Changes
+ The following changes to neutrals are meant to make pulling and stacking a more enjoyable experience. Some bugfixes were also implemented.
- Antlings, Antlore Healers, Antlore Necromancers, Zomblings, Ebulas, Skeleton Bosses, Werebeast Enchanters and Sporespitters all have their attack backswing reduced to 0.05s
- Antlore Healer's autocast Heal now has a 0 cast point & cast time, no longer interrupts his previous actions, and no longer requires him to turn to cast
- Antlore Necromancer's Summon Zombling no longer interrupts his previous actions and no longer requires him to turn to cast
- Ebula's Attack Range reduced from 500 to 300
- Zombling's Aggro Range reduced from 600 to 300
- Zombling's Movement Speed decreased from 450 to 300
- Zombling's Attack Range increased from 90 to 100
- Catman Champions, Antlore Healers, Antlore Necromancers, Vagabond Leaders and Minotaurs no longer cast their spells while asleep during night time if they are not player-controlled
- Earthroc and Werebeast's Movement Speed reduced from 350 to 290
- Werebeast Enchanter's Movement Speed reduced from 320 to 280
- Sporespitter's Movement Speed remained the same due to potential usefulness when dominated
- Werebeast Enchanter's attack point from 0.49s to 0.45s
- Skeleton King: The King's Grip state is now a debuff and is therefore purgeable
- Vagabond Leader Movement Speed increased from 300 to 320


Casual Mode exclusive changes
+ The current distribution of experience has two flaws with it; it largely favors players that survive on the outskirts of the fight even if they contributed the least, and it punishes those that are first to engage even if they contributed the most. These flaws create a high level disparity among teammates and cause players to not be properly rewarded for their contributions. Distributing experience to dead players that have earned valid assists and kills in combat will serve as a level equalizer lowering the incentive to strictly survive and allow players to still progress in levels even if they're severely behind.
- Players will now split hero kill experience with other players in range, even if they are dead, as long as they contributed to the hero kill.

+ Snowballing, when it occurs too quickly, can obsolete any meaningful decision making or good plays from the opposing team. We want matches to always be fair and interesting; when teams snowball too early, it can result in a long painful game where the result has already been determined. To combat this, we are reducing the experience bounties from heroes in the early levels and increasing it at the later levels. Teams that are behind will now gain a larger benefit when exchanging kills.
- Hero kill bounty experience changed from 90 per level to base of 40 + 35 per level + a 10 increment per level.
- Unshared EXP changed from 12 to 15

+ Gold distribution was largely favoring people that gain the killing blow. This caused a high gold disparity between teammates often times leaving supportive heroes with very little gold for their contributions while offensive heroes continue to scale excessively. We've tweaked the gold distribution in favor of team benefits to ensure all players amongst a team can have meaningful progression for their contributions in fights. Overall there will be a net increase of gold for a team, but reduction in individual snowballing.
- Kill gold bounty decreased from 400 to 350
- Assist gold increased from 50% to 70%

+ Early game deaths double down on the power difference between both teams. Firstly, a large gold and experience bounty is given to the killers. Secondly, the victims are denied valuable time to collect resources on the map. This can cause a large power difference between teams too early in the match and often times decide the result of the match before bases are even sieged. We're lowering the respawn timers in the early levels to allow players to recover quicker but evening it out at the later levels.
- Respawn timers significantly decreased at early levels, small increase at later levels.

+ When progression is so heavily centralized around hero kills, comebacks can often times be difficult for a team to accomplish, especially if they lack the resources to combat the opposing team accordingly. We've reduced the timer for creep waves to spawn additional units. With the increased creep strength occurring much sooner, teams will have more opportunities to push with creeps, while the defending teams will have more frequent access to resources. 
- Additional melee creep spawn timer decreased from 16,44,49,58 minutes to 11,33,42,50
- Additional ranged creep spawn timer decreased from 33 minutes to 22 minutes

+ Experience required to level has been tweaked very slightly to reduce snowballing by creating level milestones that serve as an equalizer.
- Adjusted hero experience tables so that it will take slightly longer to level up in the mid game but faster to level in the end game.

- New Holiday Edition Klanx Avatar: Winter Soldier
* North of Grimm's Crossing, where the Frost Fields begin their treacherous onslaught of sub-zero temperatures, Winter Soldier Klanx works in underground bunkers, dealing arms and and aiding mercenaries on both sides of the struggle for Newerth. As a benefactor of war, he uses his earnings to further his own ends, furnishing an entire subterranean lair from which he can remotely view and assist whoever he pleases. He yearns to control the positions of both sides like a twisted gamemaster, prolonging the war so he can profit further and destroying it all when he gets bored.

- New Holiday Edition Monarch Avatar: Snowflake
* Snowflake is a very graceful, kind, winged snow princess who knows how fragile and temporary life and peace can be, and all she wants is for everyone to stop fighting and enjoy the beauty of the winter season. But if these boneheads won't listen to her, it's time to chap some asses.

- New Gold Edition & Holiday Edition Shadowblade Avatar: Ghosts of Christmas
* The classic holiday story A Christmas Carol comes to Newerth in the form of Ghosts of Christmas Shadowblade, who begins as the ghost of Jacob Marley to teach your opponents the harsh lessons of being a Scrooge this time of year. Stroll with these ghosts down the memory creep lanes as he takes on the forms of Christmases Past, Present, and Yet to Come!

- New Holiday Edition Glacius Avatar: Snow Queen Shiva
* In the deepest, darkest winters when even the sunlight is frozen before it can reach the icy treetops, the inhabitants of the Frost Fields keep their hopes burning by praying to Shiva, the benevolent goddess who floats across the icebound landscape, seemingly untouched by the frigid air and offering her most precious gift: freezing her people where they lay, allowing them to sleep until the towering mountains of snow melt and the streams run free once again. It is indeed a hardy, obstinate group of people who would rather freeze to death than relocate, and they  embody the spirit of their goddess Shiva.

- New Holiday Edition Pharaoh Avatar: Festive Pharaoh (HE)
* Around this time of year, Pharaoh reserves the harshest doses of his wrath for those who won't join him in singing carols, making gingerbread houses, and fixing the dead strings of holiday lights. Why are they blinking?! When Festive Pharaoh arrives at the party, you'd better make sure your ugly sweater is Hellfire resistant and the dance floor is clear, because things are about to get Pharoah-ciously merry and the Wall of Jack-in-the-Boxes won't let you boogie into their circle.

- New Holiday Edition Succubus Avatar: Mistletoe
* What's this? A holiday tradition where you get to kiss anyone you want?! In classic Succubus behavior, the evil seductress has gone all-out in embracing the concept of mistletoe smooches, transforming her wings into smothering leaves and stems and adorning herself with ripe, swollen berries. And when she found out that mistletoe belongs to a family of parasitic plants that penetrate their hosts and absorb sustenance to survive, she decided she might want to stay this way all year...

- New Holiday Edition Amun-Ra Avatar: New Year's Eve Reborn Ra
* Amun-Ra has left a wide path of destruction behind him, and as the New Year approaches he is ready to ignite some changes in his life! He's made a resolution to bury his rage and grudges -- ashes to ashes, dust to dust and all that -- and celebrate the stroke of midnight with a pyroclasmic rebirth! He also signed up for a gym membership, so we give the whole thing about five days before he's back to the old Ra.

- New Holiday Edition Bramble Skin: Bramble of the Bells
* Bramble joins the rest of the Newerth flora heroes by getting her own festive holiday skin! Christmas is here, bringing good cheer, to young and old, meek and the bold. And Bramble of the Bells will eat them all. It may be Christmas, but she's still a carnivorous plant.

- New Holiday Taunt: Exploding Snowman
* Nothing captures the holidays better than killing your enemy and dropping a stack of frozen, exploding balls on their face. Maybe our family dinners are different than yours...

New Holiday Ward Skins
- Christmas Tree
* You don't have to be one of the three wise men to appreciate this bright star atop a festively decorated tree!
- Menorah
* It won't burn for 8 nights, but this custom ward skin will still light up your holidays!

- New Grimm's Crossing Martyr Avatar: Grimm's Medic
* Before Maliken Grimm lost himself to the daemonic and became de facto leader of the Hellbourne, he was a brilliant, brutal military commander who used ruthless tactics to unite the Five Clans of Men beneath one banner. The final clan was the Savages, and Lord Commander Grimm was forced to launch a long, bloody campaign to defeat them that culminated on the bloody, haunted ground now known as Grimm's Crossing.
* One of the other clans already under Maliken's fist was the Sacred Order, that of the Martyrs, and they served as his combat healers upon the battlefield. These battle-hardened chaplain warriors felt their souls slipping further toward peril with each life they took, but the cause was just, and they tried to save as many as they reaped.

Rulian Warlord Flint and his Dead-Eye Gang
- New Ultimate Flint Avatar: Rulian Warlord
* This is Flint at his most evolved as a warrior! He is Rulian Warlord Flint, and now that he and his Dead Eye Gang have conquered every murderous inch of the Rulian Marsh, they have erupted from the muck and mire to expand their territory while the rest of Newerth is in war-torn chaos. The Rulian Warlord is not concerned with the myriad opposition they will face - if his gang of Boggus, Skiver, Killawatt, Sinew, and Dredger can't swamp them, the endless, custom-made arsenal he carries will no doubt have the firepower to clear the way through Caldavar and beyond.

Level Progression
- 1-5: Flint as a young, wild ruffian of the Rulian Marsh.
- 6-10: Flint as a brash rogue with an impressive number of kills to his name.
- 11-15: Flint as a grizzled veteran of countless battles. Shooting first has its perks.
- 16+: Rulian Warlord Flint, ruler of all he sees and killer of anything in his way.

Weapons and Effects
- Each of the items listed below changes the guns Flint holds, and your item slots determine which gun is in which hand.
- The system first checks your item slots, left-to-right in the top row, then left-to-right in the bottom row, to see if you have two or more of the applicable items.
- If you have two or more of the applicable items, the system recognizes the first item found and puts the corresponding custom weapon in Flint's left hand. It then recognizes the second item found and puts the corresponding custom weapon in Flint's right hand.
- If you only have one of the applicable items, Flint holds the corresponding weapon in both hands.
- Each custom weapon has new effects.

Weapons Included:
- Assassin's Shroud
- Charged Hammer
- Dawnbringer
- Elder Parasite
- Firebrand
- Frostburn
- Genjuro
- Geometer's Bane
- Savage Mace
- Shield Breaker
- Shrunken Head
- Steamstaff
- Thunderclaw
- Wingbow

- New Dead-Eye Gang Chipper Avatar: Dredger
* The Rulian Gremlins are notorious for their speedy and chaotic dismantling of any equipment that rolls, stomps or flies within five leagues of the Marsh. There are countless tales of travelers stranded among the dark muck because they stepped away for relief among the shrubbery, only to return to a stripped frame and the lingering stench of gremlin farts. The other creatures of the Marsh only tolerate these devious imps because stranded travelers soon become screaming dinner, and the Rulian Warlord brought the squad of snotty gremlins aboard his Dead Eye Gang solely because they can create murder machines out of any piece of scrap they find, steal or scavenge as the crew grinds its way across Caldavar.
Owning Ultimate Rulian Warlord Flint gives Dredger an upgraded weapon and effects!

- New Dead-Eye Gang Artillery Avatar: Boggus
* Boggus earns his keep as a member of the gang by thrashing through the Rulian Marsh and tearing down any remaining structures from bygone eras, then selling the salvaged bits to the ruffians and privateers who prey upon anyone foolish enough to chart a course through the dark, forbidding territory. But he's always kept the best discoveries for the gang, and now that the Rulian Warlord has assembled the troops to exert his will upon Newerth, Boggus straps on the cannons, hefts the heavy weaponry, and lights his soggy linstock for some real, dirty fun.
Owning Ultimate Rulian Warlord Flint gives Boggus an upgraded weapon and effects!

- New Dead-Eye Gang Valkyrie Avatar: Skiver 
* In savage times, when the Rulian Harpies swooped down and snatched hapless wanderers and warriors from the narrow marsh trails, it was thought they were carried away to be judged by the deities of vengeance. As it turns out, the Harpies care not for vengeance or judgement; they just want fresh meat. Those who are skewered by a Harpy spear or feel the crushing grip of her talons soon have their bones picked clean by the flock of ravenous harridans. Skiver has set herself above the other Rulian Harpies by expanding her appetites beyond mere flesh - she also wants loot, land, and power, and the best way to reap those is by joining the Warlord's Dead Eye Gang. Skiver's nests made of bones, shattered weapons and the remnants of her victims' banners are spreading through the trees of Caldavar. If you look up and see one, it's already too late.
Owning Ultimate Rulian Warlord Flint gives Skiver an upgraded weapon and effects!

- New Dead-Eye Gang Electrician Avatar: Killawatt
* Killawatt could have gone down in Rulian history for harnessing the crackling, viscous electricity of the marsh eels and using it to bring light and power to the dark corners of the swamp, but instead he used it to fry his enemies while protecting himself with charged shields. Classic Rulian. However, the shield could not protect him from the marsh eel swimming in his custom-made power vat, and when he prodded it once too often the creature responded by biting Killawatt's arm off. Again, this is common in the marsh. This did not thwart the industrious rodent, who built himself a mechanical appendage to serve as a constant conduit for his swamp shocks. Killawat now serves as the gunsmith for the Rulian Warlord, making sure his weapons are always functional and (mostly) clean.
Owning Ultimate Rulian Warlord Flint gives Killawatt an upgraded weapon and effects!

- New Dead-Eye Gang Forsaken Archer Avatar: Sinew
* Sinew and her vicious mount Varka were the advance scouts for the roving pack of Rulian Warg Archers, known primarily for scouring miles of the dense swamp at one time, driving all living things before them and leaving behind only claw marks and a trail of carcasses. When Sinew's scouting brought her into the Rulian Warlord's sights, Flint saw something his Dead Eye Gang lacked: speed and the necrotic ability to create soldiers from the gang's victims. Sinew saw an opportunity as well - the opportunity to join the Dead Eye Gang or be turned into pink mist by Flint's hand cannons. Easy.
Owning Ultimate Rulian Warlord Flint gives Sinew an upgraded weapon and effects!

- New Legionnaire Avatar: Savior Legionnaire
* The Savior Advanced Robotic Mobile Suits (or A.R.M.S.) were discovered in a sealed military bunker buried nearly a mile below the City of Iron, unearthed by the dwarves scraping every shred of ore from the endless tunnels and caverns. They seem to have been created by a previous civilization in a time of great conflict, designed to carry elite warriors into battle and protect them from harm while allowing them to carry weapons far beyond the capability of mere humans.
* The Legionnaire was first in line to test the found technology, becoming Savior Legionnaire, and his thruster-aided charges and massive whirling blade have shown the Legion that while they have been searching for the weapon they need to defeat the Hellbourne, it is the warrior who wields it that will make the difference.

- New Ravenor Avatar: Invader Ravenor
* The Invader Advanced Robotic Mobile Suits (or A.R.M.S.) have been hastily constructed in the Electrician's Laboratory in response to the Legion's discovery of the Savior battlesuits, and a select few Hellbourne combatants have been drafted into testing them against live fire.
* Ravenor was an easy choice to be among the first wave -- if the Invader suit malfunctions and electrocutes its pilot, he won't even notice. Invader Ravenor is an augmented, evolved version of the Hellbourne Daemon Lord, and the enhancements to his lightning attacks may be enough to short-circuit the Legion's Savior campaign.

- New Limited Edition Zodiac Ophelia Avatar: Capricorn
* Capricorn has always been helpful to those in need -- even if they happen to be Olympian gods. When the vengeful monster Typhon hunted Zeus, Hera, and Bacchus after the war with the Titans, Capricorn used his intimate connection with and control over the wild beasts to transform the gods into animals so they could escape. He turned Zeus into a ram, Hera into a cow, and Bacchus into a goat, then took charge of their flight paths to ensure survival. As thanks, the gods granted Capricorn a home in the heavens as well as a powerful human form with which he can continue to protect the victimized and oppressed.

- New POGs Avatars: Scout and Glacius
* The POGs avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- Calamity will interact with the following characters: Aeacus, Abaddon, Minos, Jeraziah and Ophelia

3rd December 2014

== General ==

- Added a new Inventory Slot: The Ward Slot
+ Item progression in our game is very important; however for all roles, support especially, dedicating one inventory slot to holding wards can be a large detriment to this progression. This extra inventory slot for Wards of Sight will allow supports to more easily carry all of the required consumables for their role and enjoy more item progression than previously available. It will also allow the option of other roles to place wards when they previously couldn't due to inventory slot restriction.
* Any Wards of Sight purchased are now stored in this new location
* Can use Wards from this slot the same as any other inventory slot (default hotkey: Alt+R)
* Wards of Revelation still use normal inventory slots

- Having a friendly Ward selected now displays its reveal radius for you to see

- Winter has come to the Forests of Caldavar and Mid Wars
+ A frigid front has finally swept over Newerth turning the lush Forests of Caldavar into a replica of the chilly tundra known as Frost Fields. So grab your coats and bundle up, we wouldn't want you to get frostbite right before a big battle.


== New Content ==

- New Store Item: Ward Skins
* For the first time we are introducing Ward Skins into Heroes of Newerth. This exciting product will allow you to select a custom look for the wards your hero places. They function like Taunts and Announcer Packs, so after you purchase a Ward Skin in the Game Vanity section of the store, select it in your Vault before you enter a game.
* Your Ward Skins will have separate effects for Wards of Revelation and Wards of Sight to allow you and your teammates to identify which type of ward has been placed. The Ward Skins are completely cosmetic and have no effect on the performance of wards, their placement, or the area they affect. 
* Any player who owns a Ward Skin may select one before starting a match, and each player's Ward Skin will be displayed for all players when standard rules of gameplay allow (hopefully not by the enemy team too quickly or often).
* The first group of Ward Skins features products inspired by classic support heroes and the URSA Corps. The former will be offered as individual products and in a themed bundle for additional savings, and features wards themed for Aluna, Empath, Torturer, Pearl, and Rhapsody, and the bundle offers an exclusive Glacius-themed ward!

- New Support Hero Ward Skins
* Aluna: A glittering emerald floating above a gold and bamboo base! 
* Rhapsody: A dazzling disco ball spinning over Rhap's guitar!
* Pearl: A bubbling wand whirling over a magical base!
* Glacius: Ice shards spinning over a miniature glacier to stop the ganks cold!
* Empath: A glowing Empathic symbol over a golden base to let you know she cares!
* Torturer: A tormented skull burning above a pedestal of pain!
* Note: You do not have to play with the hero for whom the ward is themed to use that ward. For example, any hero can use the Aluna Ward Skin.

- New Ward Skin: URSA Ward Skin
* The enemies of URSA Corps cannot hope to meet them head-on in battle, so they resort to gutless ambushes and sneak attacks. Reveal their plans and your loyalty with this custom URSA Corps ward skin, and expose the enemy for the cowards they are!
* The URSA Ward Skin will be placed in the URSA chest in Plinko!

- New Announcer Pack: URSA Announcer
* Lock and load and armor up, URSA warriors! If this announcer pack doesn't get you ready to roar, you might already be dead!
* Claim the URSA Announcer Pack for free when you own these avatars: Uproar Flux, Ussuri Gauntlet, Kodia Devourer, Axia Moraxus, Barrage Bombardier, Gunclaw Gunblade, Scoria Magmus, Grizzington Benzington, and Arctos Gladiator.

- New Avatar Set: The Three Judges of All Hells
- New Puppet Master Avatar: Minos
* In ancient Greece, King Minos ordered his architect Daedalus to construct the Labyrinth to hide the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monstrosity resulting from his wife being cursed by Poseidon and spending some quality time with a bull. When Minos tried to find and kill Daedalus - the only man who knew the truth about the Minotaur - he was tricked, boiled to death, and sent to the underworld. Because of his thirst for revenge on all those who wronged him and his uncanny ability to exert his will over others, he manipulated his way into becoming one of Three Judges of All Hells, where he has ruled for centuries. Until now.

- New Accursed Avatar: Abaddon
* Overseer of the bottomless pits of the underworld and the dead cast within for all time, Abaddon the Destroyer was perfectly content wielding his cauterizing sword to sear away any glimmer of hope for the doomed souls brought before the pulpit of the Three Judges of All Hells. Now he stalks the battlefields of Newerth, hunting she who has opened the Vault of All Hells...

- New Magebane Avatar: Aeacus
* Aeacus, the Lord of Wailing and Lamentation, serves as the third Judge of All Hells and carries the sole key to the Vault of All Hells. At least he did, until someone descended into the realm of the dead, knelt for her judgement, and wreaked havoc upon the natural order of endless damnation and punishment.

* Now the Three Judges have risen to the surface of Newerth to collect what is rightfully theirs -- the harvested souls of the damned, amassed since time began --  and to exact their worst punishment yet upon the woman who released them upon the world.

- New Predator Avatar: Ba'al
* Ba'al is a principle lord of Hell and Satan's primary henchman. He rules over 66 types of lesser daemons and vast realms of Hell, and he has chosen a terrifying corporeal form in order to further his goal of creating Hell on Newerth so he can rule that as well. In the meantime, he can slaughter his way across the battlefield and send more souls to his infernal underworld.

- New Limited Edition Emerald Warden Zodiac Avatar: Sagittarius
* The Centaurs have always been a gentle species upon Newerth, wanting nothing more than to care for the beasts of the forest, enjoy peaceful music and tutor their young in the divine art of archery. Their mythological hero, Sagittarius, has always been the model of benevolence to strive for, he who made the selfless offer to replace the suffering Prometheus and in return was raised to the heavens to rest among the stars. But now the Centaurs send a different prayer to Sagittarius, one of fear and desperation and pleas to save them from extermination at the hands of the Hellbourne, and Sagittarius has answered this call by tearing himself out of the celestial sky and bringing his enchanted bow, loyal wolves, and fierce eagle with him to defend his race.

- New Behemoth Avatar: Garan the Rune Weaver
* Runeweaver Behemoth's initial concept was conjured by none other than MrKrane, the lucky winner of the Dream Avatar Contest.
As one of the grand winners, MrKrane was able to have his idea implemented into the game!
* This opportunity was brought to you by the Community Event Team ~ a group of volunteers who pledge to bring you HoN-related contests and events with huge prizes! Check out the current contests being hosted here: https://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/forumdisplay.php?321-Community-Events

* The Rune Weavers are the lesser known cousins of the Behemoths; named for their ability to weave together the ancient powers of Newerth with their own powerful magic to create Runes capable of great healing or destruction. This shrouded race of ingenious shamans reveal that the Behemoth bloodline is much more diverse than previously thought, wielding not only great physical strength, but incredible magical prowess as well.
* The Rune Weavers have an innate connection with the earth. Whilst not as physically strong as their cousins, they more than make up for this with their control over their craft. Throughout time they became ever more powerful; by finding a way to create fissures and then close them again within moments, they summoned shock waves that would flatten mountains, mimicking the feats of strength shown by the Behemoths. They would also restore the land they had damaged in the process of defending it. The Rune Weavers are a peaceful race, aiding the good and defending the weak, like their cousins the Behemoths.
* When the Hellbourne began ravaging Newerth, the Rune Weavers knew they had to delve deeper into their magic. They needed something powerful enough to aid them and their less magically adept kin to defeat the daemon plague. So they poured metal, magic, blood and sweat into what would become their greatest creation: The Portal Key.
An item so perfectly woven, it could manipulate the very fabric of the universe, opening portals to teleport the user instantly into battle. The item was particularly effective when used by their mountainous cousins, who fell upon the enemy, crushing them into the ground and sending those nearby flying. They guard their creation fiercely, allowing only the strongest Legion heroes to use them, although regrettably they have lost some to the Hellbourne as their brothers fell in battle.
* The lost Portal Keys are slowly being taken back, but not without cost.

- New Tarot Avatar: Roulette
* Roulette is a lady by day and a card shark by night; a southern belle with a venomous bite. She relies on chance to dictate her next move, and never worries about the future, knowing that she can only play the hand she was dealt. She is wellÂ­versed in probability and lucky strikes, but for all her big wins at the tables, she can never seem to find the right man; love evades her like a 53rd card. Chance can be cruel, but it can also pay off in spades.

- New Riftwalker Avatar: Possessed Riftwalker
* Delving further into the forbidden arts that allowed her to access the Rift, the Riftwalker became obsessed with the consumption and manipulation of power. The transcendence of Newerth's mortal plane thrilled her: the ability to control existence and abandon the faux dichotomy of life and death inherent in the system. As she let the Rift overtake her, her physical appearance changed as well, disguising the innocence that composed her pale face with the viscous, writhing carapace of something much more horrid, cosmetically and existentially.

- New Gold Edition War Beast Avatar: Skullcrusher
* When War Beast brought his frenzied pets from the depths of the Underworld, he included a litter of savage hellhounds he'd been experimenting with. He chose the most vicious of these and used a blend of impromptu surgery and fel magic to turn them into two-Â­legged soldiers bred to swarm Legion trenches and fortifications, then transform into their true four-Â­legged form to ensure there were no survivors.

- New Monkey King Avatar: MechaKing
* MechaKing is a melee combat machine created by Kodia of the URSA Corps in an attempt to expand their ranks beyond the elite nucleus of the crew, but she has experienced mixed results with this automated soldier due to the lack of heart and soul within the machine. MechaKing is prone to unpredictable behavior and a ruthlessness the URSA Corps does not support, but they cannot argue with the dead enemies he leaves behind.

- New URSA Corps Gladiator Avatar: Arctos
* The starving girl was one of the countless orphans of Blackwal, tossed into the blood-soaked fighting pits to be torn apart by the undead savages resurrected by Lord Salforis for his perverse entertainment. To the Baron's astonishment, the girl fought like a cornered bear, earning her the nickname Arctos, an ancient term in the realm for the terrifying beasts who stalked the dark mountain passes and left behind only screams. The girl earned her life that day and as she survived each day of brutal combat she earned water, food, and eventually weapons to fight the ever-increasing number and strength of Salforis' rotting soldiers.
When the URSA Corps raided the outpost, they freed the tormented prisoners and provided safe passage out of the Great Waste, but when everyone else fled toward the supposed protection of the Legion, Arctos refused to budge. She demanded to join the URSA Corps, and one look at what she could do with the weapons and armor provided by Kodia convinced the women she would be a valuable asset. Now she uses her Blackwal-honed combat skills against the living and dead alike, relishing the thought of facing Lord Salforis one last time.
* If Arctos kills Lord Salforis without taunting him, she will say something unique to him. The same is true if Lord Salforis kills Arctos without taunting her

- New Deadwood Avatar: Corn Stalker
* As the war rages on and the harvesting season approaches, the Hellbourne have set about scorching, trampling, and poisoning the crops to deny the enemy succor. In a stroke of depraved genius, Deadwood tainted a rolling field of Legion corn by sowing the earth with the putrid bodies of his latest victims. Their agonized souls have coalesced and risen as Corn Stalker Deadwood, who emerges from among the shadowed rows to reap a human crop of terrifying proportions.

- New Lodestone Avatar: Straw Man
* Designed with scrap materials by a gaggle of goblins, the Straw Men serve not only to keep animals away from the Beast Horde's crop fields, but also as robotic executioners for unlucky wanderers. They patrol the perimeter of farmland areas night and day, never ceasing, fueled by the corpses of people and animals they slaughter. The gigantic furnaces on their back quickly dispose of corpses, leaving no trace of the intruders to identify, and bellowing out large plumes of smoke over taller crops as a warning: enter at your own peril.

- New Madman Avatar: Raving Madman
* The inmate known as Raving Madman is believed to be a Legion foot soldier captured at the base of Watchtower by Falow the Puppet Master, who used the hapless conscript as an experiment to determine how much torture a human could endure before going insane. The Puppet Master discovered there are many levels of insanity, - each more violent and twisted than the last, and when he finally found the depths of human madness he set the Raving Madman loose upon Newerth. Now, the Legion must avoid his swiping claws and gnashing teeth while they try to capture their former comrade alive so he can be taken to the sixth dungeon of Caligo Alcazar -- the infamous former fortress of Maliken Grimm when he ruled the Legion from Adkarna -- now a prison for those condemned by malleable Legion justice. Perhaps the Legion doctors who house the violently insane can bring stillness to his writhing mind...

- New Limited Edition Zodiac Slither Avatar: Scorpio
* The eighth sign of the zodiac, Scorpio, is the most deceptive and deadly of the group. The slowÂ­burn of her enemies' life force gives her great pleasure, more so than any quick death could ever give. Few stories are ever told about her, since most of the people who encounter her perish before they can return home. Her personality is as lethal as her venom, leaving her few friends, even in the ranks of the Zodiac. The golden rule, if you see a glint of moonlight on her armor at night, is simply this: do not stick around.

- New Chronos Item Avatar: Bia - Savage Mace Chronos
* Bia is the personification of force and raw energy. As a constant companion of Zeus, she supported him in the war against the Titans, during which she saw the true power of savagery in the face of the enemy. Over the centuries she has become somewhat more subdued, softened by the devotion of her worshipers and lack of - interest in the endless wars of mankind, and this pitiful state was quickly exposed when she was summoned by Zeus to join the war upon Newerth.
The raw brutality of the war between the Legion and Hellbourne was a harsh wake-up call to the once-fierce warrior, and she is determined to take whatever action and acquire any item necessary to revert to her savage state and show these amateurs how to fight a real war.

- New URSA Corps Benzington Avatar: Grizzington
* The URSA Corps warrior known as Grizzington began as an animal rights activist who devoted her life to protecting the innocent creatures of Caldavar from the carnage of the war between the Legion and Hellbourne. The conflict has torn through fragile ecosystems, destroyed migration patterns, and left countless carcasses in its wake, pushing many species to the brink of extinction. Convinced the humans of the Legion care for the animals only as far as their pelts can bring wealth and glory, while the Beasts are too preoccupied with survival to care for their less-powerful brothers and sisters, she turned to the sisterhood of the URSA Corps and worked with Kodia to design a suit of armor for herself and her beloved creatures. The first prototype of rider and mount was christened Grizzington, and she rides forth to hunt and kill any who threaten the innocent of Caldavar.

- New Hellbourne Strength Hero: Kane the Usurper
* Kane the Usurper is an orphaned, mixed-breed warrior raised by Maliken to despise all forms of royalty and authority. His utopia is a Newerth bereft of crowns, with only the strongest and most savage allowed to hold dominion over others. He is incredibly cocky, but he can back it up, so maybe he's just confident...
* Should Kane kill Jeraziah without taunting him, a unique voice line will play

- New Kane Debut Avatar: 8-Bit Kane
* 8-Bit Kane has devoted his life to demolishing every video game record in Newerth, and with his years of dedicated training and powered-up gear, the pixels and high scores are trembling with fear. Choose 8-Bit Kane and proclaim to the world: All your base are belong to us.

* Katana is a wandering samurai with no master, on a seemingly neverÂ­ending search for the mongrel who traveled deep into the SangÂ­La Mountains, hacked his way through dozens of warriors and murdered Katana's lord.

- New Halloween Holiday Edition Rhapsody Avatar: Thriller Rhapsody
* Thriller Rhapsody is a zombie who has returned from the dead because of her love for Halloween, dancing, and brains. She digs her way out of the grave every year to boogie across Caldavar while shredding flesh with her wickedly sharp keytar and cracking open some skulls for a snack to share with her fellow zombies. Watch out if you find yourself in her hellish Disco Inferno -- zombies don't like it when you mess up their dance routine.

- New Halloween Holiday Edition Devourer Avatar: Bedsheet Devo
* Who's the corpulent, grotesque, skinless creature with the weird arm hiding under that stained bedsheet? Armadon? Puppet Master? ...Blacksmith? Ah, who knows; could be anyone!

- New Halloween Holiday Edition Silhouette Avatar: Mae Nak
* Mae Nak is a ghost from Thai folklore in a perpetual search for her husband, who fled when he realized his wife was actually a spirit. She terrorizes every living creature she encounters, blaming them for making him flee, and kills everyone she can to keep them from revealing her haunted secret.

- New Electrician Avatar: Royal Armor Osiris
* Just as the cycles of nature ebb and flow, Osiris has risen to the peak of his power and wealth due to the monarchies of Newerth flooding him with gold in an attempt to ensure life after death through his assimilation rituals. Rather than hoard this gold, Osiris has adorned himself with its luster to show everyone-rich and poor alike-what is possible when you submit yourself for rebirth through him.

- New Armadon Avatar: Scarlord
* Even gazing upon the monster known as Scarlord is enough to send chills down one's spine. Emerging from the Scar clutching a gigantic mace larger than most men, he storms to the forefront of the Hellbourne troops with only his wicked horns protruding from the ominous clouds that roll into his new stomping grounds. With each violent step, the daemon king sets fire to the environment, taking the souls of the damned with him as he travels, and, in his search for new blood to spill, not a blade of grass will be left unscathed.

- New Master of Arms Limited Edition Zodiac Avatar: Libra
* Libra seeks balance and harmony in all things, and it has become evident that the daemons coursing out of various Hells have tipped the scales of power too far toward the damned. Libra has joined the wars between the righteous and the cursed in order to restore harmony, though she is prepared to use harsh negotiation tactics should her attempts at diplomacy fall short.

- New Gladiator Item Avatar: Riftshards Gladiator
* The warrior known as Riftshards Gladiator began as a combatant so inept he was relegated by the munera overlords to the task of venturing into closing Rifts to harvest the valuable Riftshards left behind. This was nothing short of a death sentence, but the gladiator found himself growing stronger as he was exposed to the unholy, razor-sharp remnants. He was soon strong enough to lift and wield the preferred gladius and whip, then it felt like nothing to add a Punchdagger to his sword, which quickly changed to a Broadsword as his body was augmented by the invasive Riftshards. When he was fully corrupted by the shards, his body was forever changed and no mortal warrior could stand before his Riftshard arsenal.

Item Upgrades
* When the player gets Punchdagger, a Punchdagger model is added to the avatar's sword
* When the player gets Broadsword, the avatar's sword model becomes the Broadsword
* When the player gets Riftshards, shards will begin to sprout from the armor and the sword becomes a blade made of glowing Riftshards
* As the player upgrades Riftshards, even more shards will sprout from his body and armor until he is totally corrupted!

Ability Upgrades
* Pitfall now features Riftshard spikes harvested by Riftshards Gladiator
* Showdown now features a Hellbourne Rift bristling with Riftshards
* Call to Arms now summons the Riftcreatures and Battlecart used by Riftshards Gladiator to harvest his Riftshards, and the ground erupts with razor-sharp Riftshards.

- New URSA Corps Gunblade Avatar: Gunclaw
* Gunclaw tried to do it the legal way. She was deputized in Adkarna and tasked with keeping the peace in the the overcrowded refugee camps on the fringe of the city, full of humans and beasts fleeing the front lines of the battle between the Legion and Hellbourne. She failed. Crippling hunger and rampant crime infected the camps, and when the simmering rage burst into a full-blown riot the law woman knew there was no malice in the violence, only fear. She opened the massive warehouses and gave the people what they wanted - food to feed their starving children and blankets to fight the freezing nights - and almost had the turmoil contained when the Royal Guard arrived. Where she saw fear and desperation, they saw threats and revolt. The mounted warriors slaughtered everyone involved with the riot while Gunclaw screamed for them to stand down. When the killing was done, she swore to never again serve a cause more interested in power and control than peace and tolerance. And now she knows, in order to make peace, she must first make war.

- New Salomon Avatar: Wicked Wish
* Secluded for eons under the monstrous mountains of sand that litter the desert wastes, the great djinn known as Salomon waited, confined to a small, delicately crafted gold lamp. Imprisoned for the havoc he wreaked upon the world during the days of his summoning, he and the lamp were sent with an expendable wanderer to the farthest reaches of the land and buried beneath layers of earth, never to be spoken of again. It was not until a nomad, searching for the wraith who slaughtered his village, stumbled upon the lamp that the ancient evil was once more allowed to roam Newerth. The price paid to one wanderer has now become the debt of another...

- New Prophet Avatar: Dynasty
* The Phoenix Prophet is a rare, but inspiring, sight in Newerth, ushering in a sense of hope and a renewal of fighting spirit to his chosen ones. Legion or Hellbourne, the Phoenix makes no distinction, judging warriors based purely on their will to survive and conquer. His feathers beam with unearthly radiance and his skyforged weaponry is detailed with neverÂ­ending flames, captivating those lucky enough to catch a glimpse of his appearance in battle.

- New Swiftblade Avatar: Halion the Wood Elf
* It is believed the elf races evolved from a fringe element of the Fourth Clan, the Scouts, a faction that drove further into the forests of Caldavar and created a utopian society untouched by outside influence. This paradise was shattered by the Second Corruption, and the elves selected a few elite warriors to leave the elven lands to keep the Hellbourne infection from touching their sacred territory. Halion is one of these warriors, and he carries two blades, blessed by the Blind Prophet himself before his assassination. When the blades touch daemon flesh, each impact grants Halion more energy to continue his attack. With these blades, he will never tire while battling the Hellbourne.

- New Item Avatar: Insanitarius Berzerker
* Insanitarius Berzerker is a warlord from the far shores of the Seradati Plains, and he has joined the battle between the Legion and Hellbourne simply to prove he is the greatest warrior on the face of Newerth. He carries a powerful arsenal of weapons and armor from which to choose, selecting each one to instill the greatest amount of fear in the enemy he faces. His Insanitarius mask is reserved for only the most dangerous adversary, and me might soon find out everyone he faces in this war is very, very dangerous.

- New Magmus URSA Corps Avatar: Scoria
* Unpredictable, irresponsible, and "out of her mind." are only a few of the phrases attributed to URSA Magmus, the morally ambivalent girl who hides inside a giant suit of armor. Designed to withstand lava and traverse deep under Newerth to infiltrate Hellbourne spawning grounds, the power granted to URSA Magmus from the suit has rendered her a juggernaut with little competition. Although generally convinced of her loyalty, her suspicious behavior has a tendency to inspire fear, even within the corps. After all, some people want to save the world just to see it burn by their hand.

- New POGs Avatar: Doc Repulsor
* The POGs avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- URSA Corps Taunt
* A roaring, exploding bear bomb is by far the best way to display your primal dominance on the battlefield. Claim this ferocious taunt for free when you own the URSA avatars Uproar, Ussuri, Kodia, Axia, and Barrage! (Flux, Gauntlet, Devourer, Moraxus, and Bombardier)


== Bug Fixes and Optimizations ==

- The following neutrals have their aggro ranges readjusted when they are under a player's control. This fixes a bug where attack-moving with them would move the creep closer than their maximum attack range to acquire a target:

* Sporespitter

Version 3.5.5

== New Content ==

- New Vindicator Avatar: Space Wizard Merlin
* The Cosmic Warlock. The Universal Mage. The Space Wizard. Has he always existed, or did he spring into being when the planets partied? Is he a god, or simply a man who delved too far into the arts of 1980s technology? Only the wizard himself knows the answers to these questions -- and perhaps even more of life's mysteries -- but who has to the time to explain when you've got worlds to create (and then later blow-up)?

- New Artillery Avatar: Rock God Apollo
* Apollo joined the Legion forces because they worship a rival god, Sol, and he knew he deserved their offerings more than that old geezer. While his valor on the battlefield has certainly gained him a large following, the god of light and the sun, music, poetry and prophecy knows the best way to bring in the flocks of groupies is to shred some wicked riffs. Are you ready to ROCK?

- New Drunken Master Avatar: Dionysus
* Like all god-level drunks, Dionysus reveals his true self when he is most intoxicated, and he is well into his cups at this point. He is more than happy to share his endless supply of alcohol with anyone who challenges him, and once he drinks you under the table there's a good chance he'll smash it over your head.

- New Courier: Cheburashka
* We found this little guy in a crate of oranges shipped to the HoN store. He was so cute, we decided to give him a job! Pick up your own Cheburashka to use as a courier for your items (or fruit) and try not to â€œawwwâ€ too hard. He has a tendency to doze off, but he'll make sure you get your goods on time!

- New Martyr Zodiac Avatar: Virgo Martyr
* The clever, very independent goddess Virgo does not know why the inhabitants of Newerth must be constantly at war, and she would like nothing more than to restore the natural order and harmony that once existed on the planet. Rather than use her heavenly powers to destroy her enemies, she prefers to heal and assist those who share her desire for peace. Once those mates are healed, if they choose to wreak violent havoc upon the enemy, so be it! After all, Virgos are very open-minded and tolerant.

- New Bombardier URSA Corps Avatar: Barrage
* Barrage hails from the Goblin race, who have been hunted and victimized by both the Legion and Hellbourne. The former has never fully trusted the infamously devious race and keeps them on the fringe of their territories, while the latter finds Goblin souls to be foul-tasting and hard to contain; they're worth killing, but not keeping. Barrage has found her true home among the URSA Corps warriors, handling the heavy artillery and calling in airstrikes to defend her sisters and those they protect. She holds an explosive grudge against all authority and anyone who claims loyalty to the Legion or Hellbourne, and she carries the arsenal to make that grudge heard across the battlefield.

- New POGs Avatar: Devourer
* The POGs avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

Tremble
- Dark Swarm no longer interrupts commands

Version 3.5.4
-------------
== General ==

- There is a disturbance in Newerth and something is ripping open the portal to the Rift. The third map in TMM is being changed from Prophets to a variant of Rift Wars on the Mid Wars map. Snotter Boss will be included along with a change in the price of the Amulet of Rebirth (30 Gold Coins -> 60 Silver Coins).
* Rift Wars now replaces Prophets in Matchmaking
* Rift Wars is now on the Mid Wars Map


== New Content ==

- New Monarch Alt Avatar: Luna Moth
* Swooping through the trees in the dead of night and watching over the forests as a faithful guardian, the Luna Moth can be seen like a shooting star: promising hope, but rarely spotted. Some make wishes on her, others tout her as an angel, and even those who have been blessed by her presence can't say for sure what she is, except a protector of Newerth's forests who glows with the light of something otherÂ­worldly--Â­Â­ that is, if she can be spotted at all.

- New Bramble Alt Avatar: Manticore Bramble
* Which is scarier: a lion, or a giant three-tailed scorpion? If you answered "a combination of both," you've probably already heard the stories of the Manticore, who roams Newerth with an insatiable bloodlust. The barbs on the end of each of his tails secrete a paralytic toxin, capable of loosening the muscles of his prey just enough to immobilize them while he devours them whole. It is hard to gauge the panic that rushes through the body of each victim in their defenseless state, but the satisfied grin of the Manticore is enough the plague with discontent the minds of those who have not yet felt his claws ripping them to shreds.

- New Magmus Alt Avatar: Taurus
* The constellation Taurus has spent eons among the stars, enjoying the peaceful bliss and harmony of the galaxies. But the wars raging on Newerth have disrupted the balance of all things, including the heavens, and the stubborn Taurus will not tolerate such a disturbance. He has taken physical form as a powerful bull and descended to Newerth, where he will end this bothersome struggle between the Legion and Hellbourne, gather what gold he desires, and return to his place among the constellations.

- New Pearl Alt Avatar: Malice Pearl
* When Maliken sent his assassins to slaughter the Bubble Mages at the opening quake of the Second Corruption, it was thought the only survivors were Pearl and Bubbles. However, a third was overlooked: Malice, twin to Pearl, who sulked in her sister's shadow and wished for an opportunity to put the overachieving star pupil in her place. Malice's chance came when the daemons whispered to her in the night, urging her to counter the protective spells shrouding the monastery, unlock the gates, the front door...and stand aside for the massacre. Malice fled with the daemons after the murderous spree and trained with Jaru the Corrupted Disciple, Putra the Defiler, and Circe herself, honing her once-blessed sorcery into a vile weapon to use against the Legion and her damned sister.

- New Sir Benzington Gold Edition Alt Avatar: End Bringer
* Known as the "Demon Rider" to his enemies, Lancelot's End Bringer armor signified that the oncoming armies of King Arthur were not on any diplomatic missions. Their assignment was only to destroy the enemy camp or castle, leaving no trace of their existence but a smoldering crater. As he aged, his confidence only grew, putting off many former allies. Lancelot began wearing this armor almost exclusively, traveling alone, brutalizing anyone who stood before him, and refusing to take orders from anyone he respected before.

- New Master of Arms Alt Avatar: Mistress of Arms (URSA)
* Some say fear is a great motivator; Mistress of Arms believes it's a lot more useful when combined with a pair of pulsing plasma rifles. Known colloquially as "The Mistress," the URSA Corps' lady of war doesn't believe in fear, but finds great joy instilling it in others. Armed to the teeth with advanced technology, she knows every tool for every job-and who doesn't belong on her project. Her no-nonsense demeanor is relieving to some and off-putting to others, but she doesn't have any aspirations to be the leaderâ€¦ Unless it comes with a hefty paycheck.

- New Arachna Skin: Arachna (POG)
* The POGs avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.


== Bug Fixes and Optimizations ==

Monarch
- Chrysalis no longer removes the target's overhead bone visual (e.g. Bound Eye's overhead visual)

Tempest
- The cooldown on his Elemental's Replicate ability has been removed from the tooltip

Wildsoul
- Booboo's Return is now disabled when immobilized or restrained

Version 3.5.3
-------------
== New Hero ==

- New Legion Agility Hero: Tarot
* For centuries, the Ageless Oracle has been reborn at the peak of conflict to serve as the voice of the gods and share her visions with the mortals, but to never interfere. Reborn after the Beast Bone Years as Tarot, a fortuneteller who travels with her caravan of gypsies through the ravaged Forest of Caldavar, she foresaw the downfall of Maliken Grimm and the opening of The Scar but was powerless to stop it.

Now Tarot has visions of the destruction of the World Tree, and with full awareness of the doomed future of Newerth she cannot continue with mere divination. She must join the fight against the Hellbourne and tip fate, wavering on the precarious tip of destruction, toward life!

- New Tarot EA Avatar: Icosa
* Icosa is not your traditional gamer girl. While other players are content with having fun, Icosa's motivation is not only to win, but to completely obliterate her opponents until they don't want to play anymore. She takes her obsessions to the extreme, learning all the small intricacies of every game and dressing up in only the most accurate cosplay outfits to satiate her desire to be the best on and off the tabletop battlefield. Despite her tough exterior, she is still a little girl at heart, and can't help but get excited over cute drawings or plastic models.

- New Tarot Avatar: Tyche
* In ancient times the capricious goddess Tyche served as a mediator between the gods and mortals, dispensing her wealth and luck-both good and bad-according to the whims of Mount Olympus. When the gods descended from the heavens to join the battle between the Legion and Hellbourne, Tyche found herself unnecessary and forgotten. No longer! She will once again walk among mankind and share her fortune and various forms of luck, and all of Newerth will kneel and worship her (if they know what's good for them).


== Hero Balance ==

Riptide
- Watery Grave: Slow duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds
- Undertow: Deep Puddles are now back as a 30% Movement Speed slow
- Undertow: Puddle duration increased from 8/12/16/20 to 20 seconds at all levels
- Undertow: Cooldown rescaled from 25/20/15/10 to 20 seconds at all levels
- Undertow: Damage rescaled from 125 to 100/125/150/175 to enemy Heroes and 150,200,250,300 to all other units

- In My Element: Invisibility fade time decreased from 3 to 2 seconds
- In My Element: Now grants unitwalking
- Perfect Storm: Cooldown decreased from 150 to 120 seconds

Tremble
+ The tremble rework was meant to be an eye opening shift for the hero and for the community. This was to let Tremble see a fair amount of gameplay. We have been watching tremble closely and we have toned him a bit back and took him out of competitive play until we are sure he is right where he needs to be
- No longer allowed in Tournament Rules games
- Dark Swarm: Mana Cost increased from 15 to 20
- Dark Swarm: Damage per second decreased from 30/40/50/60 to 20/30/40/50

Parasite
+ Parasite has always been hard to target for a kill with the ability to infest. With the latest health changes we made Parasite become even harder to deal with. This change will ensure that Parasite can never pop out of a unit and immediately jump into another one.
- Infest: If the cooldown is below 5 seconds while inside a unit, whenever you exit the creep the cooldown will reset to 5 seconds


== New Content ==

- New Bloodhunter Skin: Balrog Gargoyle
* The Gargoyles of Blackwal have quickly embraced the horror of the war between the Legion and Hellbourne, and while some take flight directly toward the endless conflict, others take a daemonic detour into the Scar, where they plunge into the boiling, nefarious lava to be imbued with the screaming flames of tortured souls and become searing creatures who can only be quenched by rivers of blood.

- New Geomancer Avatar Skin: Chameleon Basilisk
* The eternal enemy of the World Tree continues to evolve as he seeks to poison the roots of the Legion's hope, and his new form allows him to shift the hue of his scales to blend into his surroundings. So far this has kept him hidden from Draconis, but the flame dragon will stop at nothing to protect the precious World Tree. A new form may be required by Draconis to counter the Chameleon Basilisk's transformation...

- New Gravekeeper Avatar Skin: Wave Queen Hestia
* An ally and protector of those under the sea, her followers dropped to insignificant numbers after the coastal regions of Newerth were submerged during a massive tectonic shift and the people who revered her had drowned. All that remains of the gentle goddess are a few broken statues off the western coast and remnants of small idols buried in the sand where past settlements had made their homes. Legends of her generosity still exist among certain elders, who herald her as the spirit of the water, granting fishermen their livelihood and sailors calming seas. 

- New Demented Shaman Avatar Skin: Goddess Armor Athena
* Though Athena is the deity of heroic endeavour and warfare, she is also the goddess of wisdom and strategy. Because of these attributes, she realized that while the foot soldiers appreciate her presence among the rank and file, the royalty and leadership of the Legion expect a certain level of presentation in their gods. As a result, she has strategically adorned herself in flowing white and polished gold, and now that the haughty have approved and accepted her, she can get back to killing the enemy.

- New Moraxus Avatar: URSA Corps Moraxus (HoN Tour Avatar)
* The URSA Corps is an elite unit of female warriors who have shirked all allegiance to kings, queens and causes, choosing instead to fight for justice and defence of the innocents, no matter how many enemies they gain in the process.
Axia takes her role of protector very seriously and has a very distinct sense of honor for herself and the URSA Corps. She is eager to stand between aggressors and the defenseless to absorb damage with her armor and shield, then dole out twice as much with her energy-bladed axes. There are many shallow graves across Newerth dug with axe blades and filled with foolish warriors who challenged the URSA Corps...or simply spoke ill of the all-female unit.

- URSA Gold Name Color (HoNTour Season 3)
* Show your support for the URSA Corps and HoNTour Season 3! If you own the Gauntlet, Devourer, and Flux URSA Corps avatars, charge into the Name Color department of the HoN store and claim your URSA Gold Name Color!

- Pharaoh POG
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- URSA Music Added


== Bug Fixes and Optimizations ==

- Ursa Corp Merrick effects will now play properly in the store
- Units affected by Kuldra's Sheepstick will now face the correct direction visually

The Dark Lady
- Movement animations for all her avatars fixed for low and medium graphics settings

Flux
- Magnetic Surge push effect is now visible for all alt avatars

Gemini
- Twin Fangs touch radius at the end increased to always deal damage within the stun radius

Lodestone
- Shrapnel Lodestone now holds his weapon correctly

Maliken
- Fixed graphical issues with Slasher Maliken and Humility when using Sword Throw

Wretched Hag

Version 3.5.2
-------------
== General ==

- eSports plinko has replaced the current plinko board and 25% of all proceeds will directly go into the Hontour Season 3 prizepool! For more information on the prizing breakdown visit http://hontour.com/pages/about/#plinko
- In honor of eSports plinko we have replaced the bronze chest with Ursa Corps chest, increased the odds of the chest, and added in the previous exclusive eSports avatars from the Footlocker 
- Ursa Corps avatars are still available in the Diamond and Gold chests as well


== Balance ==

+ Since the launch of 3.5 there have been numerous concerns regarding the balance of Nullstone and Riptide. Per your feedback, we've added a 150 cost recipe to Nullstone so the item is no longer dissassemblable. We are also taking a look at Riptide and will have changes for him coming in shortly!

- Null Stone
* Removed auto combine and disassemble
* Added a recipe of 150 gold


== New Content ==

- New Prisoner 945 Avatar: Dark Angel
* Even the most Virtuous have their dark sides, and Temperance ignored and denied his until he ventured into the realm of Gluttony, over-indulging in restraint until he caused the physical manifestation of his rage in the form of the Dark Angel. Behold the black wings of wrath and vengeance!

- New Martyr Avatar: Sister Death
* Several temple ruins scattered around Newerth are home to human sacrifice and bloodletting in the name of Maliken and the high demons with which he bargained. Among the female acolytes that serve the spirits, Sister Death is the highest rank achievable, a title bestowed to those with the most devotion and seniority. They alone have direct contact with demons, and are often used as sacrificial lambs on the battlefield, giving up their bodies for the sake of the Hellbourne

- New Hellbringer Avatar: Imperial Summoner
* Generations before the scientific singularity that unified much of Eclipse's galaxy, palaces existed in separate realms throughout space, their interplanetary boundaries guarded fiercely by warriors who combined technology and arcane magic. The borders required the protection of many experienced and battle-ready summoners, who, if provoked, could sap the life of intruders until they could be appropriately restrained and put through the planetary court system. In dire circumstances, or in the event of a raid on government buildings, the summoners were able to control large beasts to tank most of the attacking force's ammunition. Their weaponry and back pieces symbolized the cruel punishment that lay in store for foreigners who disobeyed the orders of the rulers on those planets. 

- New Swiftblade Avatar: Cyber Samurai
* The Cyber Samurai is a perfectly programmed, armored killing machine. By melding ancient Japanese form with futuristic armor to synthesize a slick, undetectable mercenary, the silent assassin is as tough as he is eloquent, leaving no trace of his presence once he has massacred his targets. Developed alongside Exterminator Nomad as a method of security for restricted areas that were not yet burdened by corrosive gas and extreme weather, the Cyber Samurai was a modern marvel before the Fall of Man, silencing those who sought to silence. Detailed by its engineers with more finesse, and an emphasis on many quick slashes over a few large ones for increased probability of damage, the cauterizing blades would leave less to clean up when the infiltrators were disposed of. The unflinching samurai warrior epitomized the cold-blooded murderer, moving onto his next assignment with no remorse or time for contemplation

- New Scout Avatar: Hermes
* For centuries Hermes has carried messages and souls from Newerth to the afterlife-and avoided getting involved in the drama of mankind-but he could no longer stand by when the Hellbourne began poaching thousands of heaven-bound souls and using them for their fell means. And when he heard the rumor that wench Circe had joined the daemons, he couldn't run to the battlefield fast enough.

- New Devourer Avatar: Kodia, URSA Corps Devourer (HoN Tour Avatar)
* Kodia uses her mechanically superior brain to create the brawn for the URSA Corps, sifting through Legion and Hellbourne junkyards to salvage what her squad needs to survive and protect those caught between the warring factions and their vacillating, haphazard strategies. She will defend her URSA sisters to the death, and if that day comes she'll take as many enemies with her as she can.

- New Zephyr Avatar: Zephyr POG
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.


== Bug Fixes and Optimizations ==

- Fixed tooltip errors with some of the balance changes

Rampage
- Stampede now shows a visual indicator (visible to allies only) above the enemy target while Rampage is charging that target 

Riptide
- Fixed interaction between Watery Grave and Undertow

Circe
- Klanx's Lackey and Zephyr's Cyclones will be cleared properly if Circe copies one of those heroes with Twisted Visage and its duration expires

Flux
- Can no longer pull or push Artesia's Essence Projection or Engineer's Steam Turret

Hellbringer
- Malphas pets are properly displayed in the HoN Store and Learnatorium for all alt avatars

Moira
- Shards of Harkon projectiles apply their proper damage & stun in midair & if cast by the Spirit Mimic and the Spirit Mimic dies before the projectiles impact

Soul Reaper
- Withering Presence: Illusions will now take away HP at 1/3 of the regular rate

Tremble
- Boris' Ensnare now has its proper icon again
- Dark Swarm debuff no longer displays the debuff on buildings 
* No gameplay effect, i.e. Dark Swarm still reduces damage if buildings are outside the Dark Swarm radius
- Dark Swarm no longer mitigates damage against invulnerable units that are inside the Dark Swarm radius
- Impalers no longer apply a slow debuff to buildings


Version 3.5.1
-------------
== General ==

+ This patch does not follow our normal patching schedule due to the HoNTour Qualifiers starting on Saturday, July 26th. We will still be updating the game on Wednesday, July 30th.

- HoNTour games now provide 25 Silver Coins for a loss and 50 Silver Coins for a win
- HoNTour games no longer allow you to use Modded files
* If you are using modded files you will be disconnected and informed to uninstall/delete modded files


HoN 3.5: The Carry's Calling
-------------

+ The purpose of this balance patch is two fold. The first is to bring carries into a more viable role and the second is to make sure that in doing so gank heroes can maintain their effectiveness. The goal in this was rather straight forward.


== General ==

Rift Wars
- Repick cost decreased from 400 to 150

Sporespitter
+ In the past we removed a lot of the abilities Neutral creeps had which randomly negatively impact a player as they run by. We removed the Attack Speed slow for this same reason: It did not add anything to the interaction of the camp but made it really annoying to fight.
- Removed the 20% Attack Speed slow from the debuff

Tournament Rules 
- Silhouette, Cthulhuphant, Shadowblade, and Riptide are now available in Tournament Rules

- Reverted the Birthday celebrations - Creeps, Kongor, Runes
- Snotter Boss has been removed from Mid Wars again
- Added a new effect for all forms of Splash Damage (Runed Cleaver, Hammerstorm, Maliken, Shadowblade, etc)


== Hero Balance ==

+ The interaction with charges and other forms of CC were out of place and so we have adjusted it so that all charges now function the same and the interaction is clean.
- Charges from Legionnaire, Nomad, and Solstice are now broken by stun/immobilize/restrain/sheep

Andromeda
+ Andromeda has always been a high, risk high reward hero. With this change the risk and reward are still high but Andromeda won't be signing her death warrant every time she uses her Void Rip.
- Void Rip: Now grants Andromeda 30/40/50 tapering armor over 6 seconds

Sir Benzington
+ We've evaluated Sir Benzington as being a little too strong in lane.  With this change, it will cost him more to use Lance a Long to harass as well as allow his enemies the ability to more effectively stop his escape since he won't travel as far after landing a Joust.
- Lance a Long: Mana Cost increased from 75/80/85/90 to 85/100/115/130
- Joust: Distance traveled after hitting a target decreased from 275 to 175

Blacksmith
+ A staff was added to allow more of what we have all come to love about Blacksmith... RNG
- Staff of the Master (SOTM) added: Chaotic Flames
- Chaotic Flames (SOTM): Your auto attacks now have a 10% chance to cast Fireball, Flaming Hammer, or Frenzy
* These abilities do not share cooldowns with your normal abilities

Chronos
+ Chronos has arguably one of the most powerful and difficult skill sets to deal with. The changes introduced here are to make Chronos less of a threat in lane and make it slightly more difficult for him to land a game changing Chronofield.
- Starting Armor decreased from 3.9 to 2.5
- Starting Strength, Agility, and Intelligence decreased by 1
- Base Attack Damage decreased from 58-64 to 53-59
- Chronofield: Cast range decreased from 500/550/600 to 500
- Chronofield: Cooldown  rescaled from 120/110/100 to 120
- Chronofield: Units inside take 25% less damage from anyone outside of the field

The Chipper
+ The Chipper is a hero that has always been fun to play and requires more skill to master than most heroes, however Sawblade Showdown was either being used for farming or saved for a team fight. With this change Chipper can find himself using Sawblade Showdown more freely and setting up ganks more often.
- Sawblade Showdown: Cooldown decreased from 65 to 65/55/45

Cthulhuphant
+ Cthulhuphant's aura had become overly frustrating and hard to play around so we decided to give players playing against the phant more options to avoid it.
- Dream of Madness: No longer goes through Magic Immunity
- Dream of Madness: Insanity is now transferrable
- Dream of Madness: Cooldown decreased 32/28/24/16 to 32/30/28/26

Defiler
+ We wanted to help her early laning phase with this slight tweak.
- Starting Agility increased from 16 to 18

Demented Shaman
+ We found that since Demented Shaman's debuff lasts a long time there should be a way to remove it early.
- Entangle: Now purgable/dispellable

Draconis
+ We want Draconis to be the go to AOE magic damage carry so we made the following changes:
- Fiery Barrage: Area of Effect increased from 175/200/225/250 aoe to 250
- Cataclysmic Assault: Targets increased from 1/2/3 to 2/3/4

Drunken Master
+ We found Drunken Master to be hitting too high of a threshold in higher levels of TMM and diminishing play-around with Untouchable that said "haha you can't hurt me". These changes are hitting up-time and duration which means Drunken Master must choose wisely when activating Untouchable.
- Untouchable: Cooldown rescaled from 60/45/30 to 50 at all levels
- Untouchable: Duration decreased from 6/8/10 to 5/6/7 seconds

Ellonia
+ This will give Ellonia another option of play, granting a powerful AOE stun in team-fights.
- Staff of the Master (SOTM) added: Absolute Zero
- Absolute Zero (SOTM): Upon reaching its final destination the ball fires back towards Ellonia at 3x the speed, casting Flash Freeze on everyone hit

Flint Beastwood
+ A consistency change that aims at making Hollow-point scale properly.
- Hollow-point: Stun duration rescaled from .05/0.1/0.2/0.2 to 0.05/0.1/0.15/0.2

- Gauntlet Blast (SOTM): Area of Effect increased from 200/225/250 to 300/350/400

Glacius
+ We wanted to give Glacius' leveling options a little more balance.  The following changes were made to his passive to make it more viable: 
- Chilling Presence: Now also passively grants 50/100/150/200 max mana to all allies

The Gladiator
+ A small Quality of Life change was added to help The Gladiator be more useful and more proactive in team fights.
- Call to Arms: Cooldown decreased from 100/90/80 to 60/50/40 seconds

Grinex
+ These changes further emphasize Grinex's primary focus on early game power.
- Base Attack Damage increased from 51 - 55 to 54 - 58
- Starting Agility increased from 22 to 24
- Shadowstep: Mana Cost decreased from 125 to 100/110/120/130

- Mighty Swing: Splash Radius rescaled from 175/200/225/250 to 150/200/250/300
- Mighty Swing: Splash Damage increased from 15/30/45/60% to 30/40/50/60%

Klanx
+ Klanx is an amazing ganker but one of the squishiest heroes in our game.  These changes are aimed at making him better in lane and a better overall ganker.
- Lackey: Projectile Speed increased from 900/1000/1100/1200 and to 1200 at all levels
- B.A.N.G: Mana Cost decreased from 80 to 65
- H.A.W.K: Mana Cost decreased from 80 to 65
- Goon Squad: Movement Speed increased from 230/245/260 to 300

Myrmidon
+ Myrmidon will now be able to get a little more damage out of Forced Evolution with the Magic Armor debuff lasting longer as well as a slight boost to his laning.
- Armor increased from 1.1 to 1.5
- Wave Form: Magic Armor Debuff Duration increased from 3 to 6 seconds

Parasite
+ After removing some of Parasite's burst damage, we decided we wanted to focus more on his unique strength of utilizing creeps.  At max level you now have regen while you are infesting a creep instead of constant health loss.
- Infest: Attack Speed increased from 15/30/54/60 to 20/40/60/80
- Infest: Damage bonus increased from 1/2/3/4x level to 2/3/4/5x level
- Infest: Health loss rescaled from -3/-2.5/-2/-1.5% to -3/-1.5/0/+1.5% per second

Puppet Master
+ These changes lower Puppet Master's burst potential giving more play around to a very strong hero.
- Whiplash: Critical multiplier decreased from 1.5/1.75/2/2.25 to 1.4/1.6/1.8/2
- Voodoo Puppet: Damage amplification decreased from 1.5/1.7/1.9x to 1.4/1.6/1.8x

Rhapsody
+ A straightforward nerf to one of the strongest stuns in the game.
- Staccato: Cooldown increased from 12 to 15 seconds

Riptide
+ Riptide, as many of you have mentioned, suffered from only being good as a mid laner. We agree that this made him a very situational pickup. With the changes to undertow he now can effectively keep up water in other lanes without having to completely rely on Perfect Storm.
- Undertow: Cooldown decreased from 30/25/20/15 to 25/20/15/10
- Undertow: Duration increased from 8/10/12/14 to 8/12/16/20
- Undertow: Deep Puddle mechanic removed

Salomon
+ A simple Quality of life change to make his Cosmic Cleave easier to use on the run.
- Cosmic Cleave: Cast Action Time decreased from 300 to 100ms

Scout
+ Wards can not be missed uphill, and Electric eye is performing the same task so the following change was made for consistency. 
- Electric Eye: Can no longer be missed

Silhouette 
+ This change is a slight tweak to her recent rework, allowing her a little more laning capability.
- Attack Range increased from 350 to 400

Solstice 
+ Ganking at early levels on this hero was way too easy. This change allows Solstice to still gank but much more finesse is required.
- Blinding Dash: Cast Range decreased from 1200 to 600/800/1000/1200

Valkyrie
+ Valkyrie is a hero that has a very solid niche in our game for lock downs and team fights. However she was suffering from basic lack of Health, Armor, and overall Mana. With these changes she will be able to access her abilities more often and take more risks becoming a stronger off laner.
- Starting Strength, Agility, and Intelligence increased by 1

Tremble Rework
+ This rework is aimed at reducing his mana costs and increasing his map presence, while at the same time making it less frustrating to play with and against.  

+ Dark Swarm now being a toggle will make Tremble a capable farmer and add solid amount of dps to any target he faces. Terror mounds will now be easier to deal with for the enemies, but because you can have more of them and they have a low mana cost you can place them more frequently, making the frustration level on both sides greatly diminished. Impalers changing to a double attack is a directional change that gives tremble some more options in the way of Proc items like Thunderclaw and Brutalizer. Oh and a buffed Boris will increase damage output with Tremble and make him a threat as a ganker once more. YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!
- Starting Agility increased from 18 to 22

- Dark Swarm: Now is a Toggle ability 
- Dark Swarm: Costs 15 mana per second it is activated
- Dark Swarm: Deals 30/40/50/60 Physical Damage per second in a 300 radius

- Terror Mounds: Mana Cost decreased from 120 to 50
- Terror Mounds: Cooldown decreased from 60/50/40/30 to 20 seconds at all levels
- Terror Mounds: Max active increased from 2/4/6/8 to 3/6/9/12
- Terror Mounds: No longer invisible
- Terror Mounds: Max Health decreased from 4/4/5/6/ to 4
- Terror Mounds: Gold Bounty decreased from 35/40/45/50 to 25
- Terror Mounds: Duration before mounds heal decreased from 6 to 3 seconds
- Terror Port: Cooldown decreased from 120/100/80/60 to 60 seconds at all levels

- Impalers: Movement Speed Slow rescaled from 10/20/30/40% to 15% at all levels
- Impalers: No longer does bonus damage or heal on the first attack
- Impalers: Bonus 5/10/15/20 Damage removed
- Impalers: Every attack against Enemy Units and Structures now causes a double attack that does 20/25/30/35% of the your Attack Damage

- Hive Mind: Mana Cost decreased from 100/125/150 to 50/75/100
- Hive Mind: Cooldown decreased from 90/75/60 to 60 seconds at all levels
- Boris: Movement Speed increased from 350/375/400 to 400 at all levels
- Boris: Mana Regen increased from 1 to 1.5
- Boris: Base Damage increased from 60/85/110 to 60/90/120
- Impalers (Boris): Movement Speed Slow rescaled from 10/15/20% to 15%


== Item Balance ==

New Item: Veiled Rot
+ This new item has been placed in the game to allow gank heroes and ganking in general to remain a viable strategy.  With the increased strength in carries and the items that carries get being cheaper, this will offset some of those buffs and create more action.
- Consumable

- Cost decreased from 2100 to 1500 gold
- Attack Speed decreased from 55 to 40

Thunderclaw and Charged Hammer Reworked

Thunderclaw
- Components
* Old: Warhammer(1600)+Gloves of the Swift(500)+Recipe(800) = 2900 gold

- Stat Bonus decreased from 15 to 10

Behemoth's Heart
+ A tweak to the price allowing it to be purchased slightly earlier in the game.

Nome's Wisdom
+ This change is to bring Nomes in line with its melee counterpart Abyssal skull.

Runed Cleaver
+ This increase in power is to allow carries to get more farm and reach their potential earlier in the game.

- Damage decreased from 40/55/70 to 36/48/60

Spellshards

+ This item is incredibly good for it's cost, but the activation cost was a bit of a burden for usability.
- Mana Cost from 25 to 10

+ These changes were made to Blood Chalice to revert some of it's earlier nerfs. This was done in tangent with the Null Stone change  to make sure it would not fall out of favor.

- Mana gained increased from 85 to 100

Void Talisman
+ This change updates Void Talisman to Shrunken Head's standard. Shrunken dispels all Magic effects when it makes you Magic immune, so now Void Talisman dispels you of all Physical effects when it makes you Physical immune.
- Dispels Physical-type effects on use

- New Vindicator Avatar: Merlin Vindicator
* Merlin is an old man who has practiced magic for a long time, and was an advisor to Maliken before he was corrupted by Sylvia. Merlin left the luxury of the Legion castles to pursue magic research, as he foresaw the crumbling hierarchy of the throne and did not wish to be a part of it. He emerged once more when Jeraziah was ready to take the throne, hoping that the time he spent studying and his years of experience could lead the Legion back to its former glory.

- New Artesia Avatar: Artesia le Fay
* The sorceress known as Artesia le Fay was once a protege of Amiteah the Empath, learning her healing spells and fighting for the survival of Newerth. She envisioned herself standing with Jeraziah, queen to his king, with their offspring carrying the Legion banners forth and driving the Hellbourne back into their pits. But Jeraziah had no love for her. His heart was dedicated to Sol-or so he claimed-and he could not be tempted by her beauty or promises of carnal pleasure. But Artesia le Fey knows the true reason for Jeraziah's rebuff: his secret suspicion that her magic comes not from Sol and the World Tree, but from a much darker place. Her heart blackened by rejection and fury, Artesia le Fey vowed to destroy Jeraziah and his precious god, and when she is done she will throw his royal blade into the Inner Sea, where it will be lost for all of time.

- New Tempest Avatar: Shark Hunter Poseidon
* Who's the most fearsome under the sea? Shark Hunter Poseidon is a strong and intimidating god who frightens his enemies by searching for, killing, and wearing the skin of great white sharks to prove his dominance. By decorating himself in the tanned carcasses of the ocean's fiercest hunters, the surly sea god could just as easily pierce you with his gaze as he could with his trident... Which is also made of sharks.

- New Tremble Avatar: King Crab Tremble
* Legion soldiers take great care when passing through Caldavar on their way south, for fear of running into "The King." Scuttling as fast as infantry can run, and equipped with a large, threatening pincerÂ­Â­ big enough the cut an armored man in half,Â­Â­ King Crab Tremble protects his beaches with help from the watchful eyestalks of his hermit crab flunkies. The collected crushed helmets of soldiers litter the inside of his labyrinthian tunnels, while his minions stay vigilant picking up carcasses and leftover meat for the hive.

- New Plague Rider Avatar: Olympus Armor Pegasus & Bellerophon
* For their stellar service in defending the Legion and defeating creatures both daemon and mythological, Pegasus and Bellerophon have been gifted with enchanted gear and a cloud of Olympus by Zeus himself. The dazzling opalescent armor and weapons instill awe and fear among the daemon ranks, and no enemy can stand before the galloping thundercloud of Olympus and brilliant attacks Pegasus and Bellerophon bring to the battlefield.

- New URSA Corps Gauntlet Avatar: Ussuri (HoN Tour Avatar)
* Ussuri is the youngest member of the URSA Corps, but is outfitted with one of the deceptively strongest bio-suits in the group. After her right arm was left paralyzed in a skirmish for food against nomadic bandits, her only choices were to leave the group or devise a new method of attack, since the corps could not afford injured soldiers. With the help of Kodia, the brilliant URSA mechanic, Ussuri was able to construct a large robotic arm, capable of dishing out extreme amounts of pain. Her spunky attitude has never been stronger, and her thirst for destruction since the incident has only been amplified.

- New URSA Corps Flux Avatar: Uproar (HoN Tour Avatar)
* The quiet storm of the URSA Corps: Uproar is an intelligent and dangerous woman who speaks softly and carries a big stick (or gun, in this case). As a young girl, she quickly developed an interest in science-- physics, in particular-- as she watched her town's population dwindle after unarmed civilians would be eaten by the Hellbourne or conscripted by the Legion. Both sides were out to get her, and the only way to stop them was through advanced technology; something nobody else could stand up to.

- POGS: Witch Slayer, Bubbles, Blood Hunter, Behemoth, Balphagore, The Chipper
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- New Sir Benzington Alt Avatar: Lancelot Benzington
* The head of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, the impressive Â­Â­ but arrogant Â­Â­ Lancelot was a frightening warrior, unmatched in his abilities with the cavalry. His iconic lance was considered a prized weapon, enhanced with magic by Arthur's court wizard, Merlin, who saw a great future in the boy from a young age. A bit too pretentious for his own good, he often  rubbed people the wrong way, including Arthur's trusted Green Knight, with whom he had a respectable but rocky relationship. 

- New Gold Edition Legionnaire Alt Avatar: Kurgan Legionnaire
* There can be only one... Gold Edition Legionnaire! Even the most hardened soldiers of the Hellbourne shy away when The Kurgan joins the fight-especially those who consider themselves immortal. While most daemons seek victory, blood, and souls from Man and Beast, The Kurgan scours the battlefield for only the most potent life-force, and he cares not if he takes if from Legion, Hellbourne, Rift, or Chiprel. And if your life-force is deemed unworthy of collecting, you'll most likely be tossed into the dog pit for amusement. But don't lose your head! As long as he doesn't decapitate you, you can come back for another go. Wait, his Ultimate ability is called Decapitate? Well played, Kurgan.

- New Accursed Alt Avatar: Green Knight Accursed
* Formerly the most powerful knight in Newerth, long before the reign of King Maliken, the Green Knight was a proud and vigilant defender of Caldavar's monarchy. His strength and cunning was a blessing to the Legion on the battlefield, as well as in the  barracks, where he devoted his time to teaching infantry soldiers. His humanity came to a halt after his body was destroyed by a sorceress, trapping his soul in his armor. 

- New Soulstealer Alt Avatar: Redeemed Hades
* Now that he has been redeemed by Zeus, Hades can once again travel among the living without keeping one foot in the underworld. While he does enjoy the living world, he misses his kingdom of the dead. Redeemed Hades feels even more animosity toward Zeus now; he thinks his younger brother redeemed him out of pity and as a show of his power. Redeemed Hades still believes his underworld is a great place to be, and he will send as many heroes there as he can. 

- New Holiday Edition Moon Queen: Lady Liberty Moon Queen
* Lady Liberty is a beacon of hope, a light in the darkness, and a symbol of freedom throughout Newerth, but nothing shines brighter than her ego. She is a champion for those who cannot fight for themselves, espousing the truths of liberty and justice, though her methods can seem reckless, even counterÂ­intuitive at times. Regardless, she is respected throughout the land for her bravery and cunning, waving the stars and stripes as she flies between army regiments, uniting her own and dividing the enemy. 

- New POGS Alt Avatar: Forsaken Archer (POG)
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- 'Expanding Sol's Theatre' - A $10,000 Community Map Making Contest
* 'Expanding Sol's Theatre' is a community driven, company guided map making contest that gives the players of Heroes of Newerth the power to build and design the newest maps that will enter Newerth. The contest will be separated into three parts and there will be prizes won at the end of each section. 'Expanding Sol's Theatre' starts on August 1st, so gather up some ideas and get ready to make your map a reality!

- Map Rotation 
* The Map Rotation (an idea inspired by the community) will be a new process that is being implemented into Heroes of Newerth by the HoN team! The goal of the Map Rotation is to continually offer up different game modes in HoN's Team Match Making (TMM) creating a more exciting TMM experience! Any map is eligible to come back into that third TMM slot but the amount of time that they will remain in that slot will depend on the popularity of the map.

* Prophets has been added to the Matchmaking screen as the first Map in the rotation, replacing Rift Wars.

- New Ultimate Rampage Avatar: Wyvern Rampage
* A self-assured brute and military aide to the old king, Wyvern Rampage is no stranger to the battlefield. Starting as a mounted soldier and working his way up through bloody victories, he quickly gained the appreciation of the royal family, and was rewarded with special missions that involved finding dragon dens, raiding them of their stolen loot, and slaughtering the dragons inside. He was allowed to keep half of every bounty he found, and sometimes wears the restored armor as a practical trophy. He has no qualms about turning Newerth into his new "stomping grounds."

- New Riptide Avatar: Pisces
* When the giant horror Typhon descended upon Mount Olympus, two fish guided Aphrodite and Eros through the churning waters and helped them escape to safety. These fish were raised to the heavens and became the constellation Pisces, and there they have remained until the cries of the innocents across Newerth compelled them to return. This time, however, they will not simply guide fleeing refugees to safety-they will harness the unstoppable power of water and use it to drown the monsters who threaten god and man.
Side note: Pisces is said to be a representation of the difficulty in extracting the good from that which appears bad. Because of this, Pisces is now our Lead Forum Administrator.
 
- New Bubbles Avatar: Venus De Bubbles
* Venus de Bubbles is a lifelong friend and student of the living constellation Aquarius, and when her mentor joined the fight against the daemons Venus was eager to follow, both to learn the ways of  the world outside of her protective sea and to make sure no harm comes to Aquarius.

- New Defiler Avatar: La Llorona
* Known throughout Newerth as "The Weeping Woman," La Llorona is a ghastly spectre who haunts the areas surrounding the Inner Sea. She does not pose a threat if viewed from a distance, but within her vicinity, the Banshee of Blood will erupt with anger and jealousy, spewing forth the souls of drowned children from her gaping mouth and piercing the sky with her shrieks of existential dread.

- New War Beast Avatar: Shock Troop War Beast
* The Hellbourne's Shock Troop War Beasts are chosen from the ranks for their complete lack of fear and what seems like a manic desire to die in battle. They are the first wave of soldiers sent against the Legion phalanxes and fortifications with the sole mission of killing as many enemies as they can before they die. Once they are slain, their stacked bodies provide convenient ramps for walls and filling for ditches so those who follow can claim the glory of victory.

== New Content ==

- New Hero: Moira
* Harkon's young apprentice is still learning how to control the arcane energy coursing through her body, and it takes every ounce of her will to keep the destructive power from obliterating everything around her. She fights for the Legion to avenge the murdered Harkon while she seeks the experience and hidden magics that will let her be at peace once again, though that seems like a futile hope amid the chaos of her existence.

- Ability 1: Shards of Harkon
* Moira conjures up two Shards of Harkon, consuming one and tossing another to an Ally. After a short time they explode, stunning and damaging nearby enemies.
* Target an Ally (or self). After a 1 second delay, two Shards explode out from you, dealing 70/140/210/280 Magic Damage and applying a 1.25/1.5/1.75/2 second Stun to the 2 nearest enemies. After an additional 1 second delay, Shards will explode out from the targeted ally, with the same effect.
- Ability 2: Mana Sunder
* Target an enemy hero to completely empty their Manapool. After a short delay, they regain all of the Mana they lost.
* Target an enemy hero to destroy all of their Mana, dealing 1/2/3/4x their Intelligence in Magic Damage. After a 1/1.5/2/2.5 second delay, they slowly regain all the Mana they lost. If the enemy casts anything while they are regaining Mana, their Manapool goes back to 0 and after a 1 second delay, they regain it all again.
- Ability 3: Ephemeral Forge
* Target a location within range to create a Spirit of yourself there. The Spirit can cast spells like you and use your items, but your hero is vulnerable!
* Target a location to channel and create a Spirit Mimic of yourself for 10/14/18/22 seconds. The Spirit takes 250% damage and can use all items and spells freely. When the Spirit casts a spell, Moira loses Mana equal to its cost. If Moira is stunned or silenced, the ability ends.
- Ability 4: Arcane Vortex
* Target a location to overload it with unstable Arcane energy, ripping a hole in the fabric of reality. All nearby units are sucked into the energy.
* Target a location to suck all nearby units into an Energy Vortex for 4 seconds. The Vortex grows over time and you cannot target or interact with anyone inside. For 2.5 seconds after it ends, all caught Enemies are Slowed by 35%, and take 125/250/375 Nonlethal Magic Damage; while Allies have +35% Movement Speed.

- Debut Moira Avatar: Hecate
* Hecate is the Greek goddess of witchcraft, guardian of the household, and goddess of the three paths of the crossroads, which is why she presents herself with two additional faces on her shoulder pauldrons. In ancient times Zeus allowed her to grant humanity any gift she wished, and based on Newerth's choices in the crossroads of life she has returned to grant us all a well-deserved ass whoopin.

- New Moira Avatar: Singularity
* Singularity Moira carries the dying energy of a collapsed planet within her. She has searched the galaxy for a new home to share the intelligence and emotions gained from her planet's existence, and now she has arrived upon Newerth. What do you think-could we use some more intelligence here?

- New Vindicator Avatar: Sexy Librarian
* School's out, and this curvy mistress of literature can't wait to unbutton and chase some Canterbury tail. When this vivacious wordsmith takes you back to the biology section, get ready to hit more than the books!

- New Predator Avatar: Russian Battlebear
* A military experiment gone wrong, the Russian Battlebear is a hybrid of nature's fiercest beast and man's toughest machinery. Decorated with custom plates recycled from old Russian tanks, the Battlebear was supposed to lead the Soviets to victory in the 1960's, but could not be contained for long after the experimental procedures had started. His brute strength, combined with durable armor, overpowered waves of scientists and military personnel, and his massive blades cut through the ranks he was supposed to defend, leaving his sterile holding cell a slaughterhouse

- New Blood Hunter Avatar: Gargoyle
* The stone grotesques carved from the towers of Blackwal were intended to protect the inhabitants and ward off evil spirits, and they did a fine job, but their hideous faces could do nothing to deter the malevolent forces growing within. When Lord Salforis harnessed the dark energies pouring from the Scar to raise his army of the dead, the gargoyles pulled their stone claws free and stretched their heavy wings, hungry to fill their wide gullets with rivers of blood.

- New Courier: Izbushka
* What better way to intimidate the enemy and impress your cohorts than to have your items delivered by a flying chicken hut? If they don't think you're awesome, they'll think you're insane. Which is better in HoN.

- Corrupted Disciple (POG)
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

Version 3.4.3
-------------
== New Content ==

- Added new Drunken Master Alt Avatar: Rum Master  (Bloodtide Brigade)
* Another mate on Baaracko's ship, Rum Master's addictive personality gave him little incentive to ever advance beyond swabbing the poop deck, content to bathe in the dark amber ambrosia that kept him in a perpetual stupor. When Captain Gorebeard took over the ship, he was not concerned with the changing tide, if he even knew it took place. As long as he gets to drink, fight, and plunder, nothing seems to matter, and the compass in his pocket points truer than the one for his morals.

- Added new Magebane Alt Avatar: Syphon Magebane (The Shroud)
* When The Shroud is hired to assassinate a powerful magician, Syphon is the member of the elite killing squad who gets the task. Syphon has no allegiance to a particular god or mystical source-in fact, he considers these to be crutches and weaknesses for those he is sent to kill. Once he drains them of their mana and magical abilities, they are simply defenseless, easy prey, and their incantations and prayers are soon silenced.

- Added new Fayde Alt Avatar: Vanish Fayde (The Shroud)
* Vanish is the most elusive member of The Shroud. She is a master of shadows, using her target's own shade against them and blending herself completely into darkness to move undetected among the gloom. When-or if-you do see her, it is much too late.

- Added new Zephyr Alt Avatar: Parrot Zephyr (Bloodtide Brigade)
* A glorified "yes man" to Captain Gorebeard during Baaracko's reign as captain, Cockatoo moved up in rank alongside the rotund usurper. He is the eyes and ears aboard the vessel, telling Gorebeard all the things the deckhands say or do in private.

Entrusted with the treasure map of the fabled Grimoire of Power (in case the crew mutinies and kills Gorebeard), he stands beside his captain with beady, piercing eyes, ready to fight or fly, depending on what the situation calls for. He is a bothersome, oversized loudmouth whose allegiance is only to whoever happens to be in charge. With an impressive wingspan and the trust of the largest man on the ship, his annoying presence transforms into something far more fearsome.

- Added new Shadowblade Alt Avatar: Husher Shadowblade (The Shroud)
* Husher is leader of The Shroud and the ultimate assassin, capable of altering his attack style to quickly dispatch any target. Those who prove difficult to kill find their own strengths used against them when Husher harnesses the dark, murderous magic contained within the four ancient blades he carries, each capable of inflicting tremendous harm. When they are combined into the Blade of the Shroud, a weapon controllable by only the most skilled assassin alive, his targets are quickly hushed for good.

- Added new Devourer Alt Avatar: Captain Gorebeard (Bloodtide Brigade)
* Captain Gorebeard is a corpulent, greedy, obnoxious pirate captain with no sense of morality. His gigantic stature and history of murder has allowed him to take command of the Bloodtide Brigade, a team of pirates previously under the command of another captain, by using physical and mental intimidation. He seeks only hedonistic pleasure, gorging on food and surrounding himself in stolen treasure, while his crew maintains his lifestyle in fear of losing their own lives. He would stab a man in the front just as soon as he would stab them in the back.

- Bonus Set Effects for the Bloodtide Brigade

- Captain Gorebeard (Devourer)
* He gains a gold shader on his sword and hook
* He gains a parrot buddy on his shoulder.
* Ability 1: Booty of coins and gems explode at the impact site.

- Rhapscallion (Rhapsody)
* Ability 1: This ability gains seagulls flying randomly from the targeted character.
* Ability 4: This ability gains a flock of seagulls flying above her head.
- Corsair (Artesia)
* Ability 1: This ability gains a cannonball projectile.
* Ability 4: This ability gains a spinning cannon tower model which fires cannonballs when she uses her Ability 1.

- Bonus Set Effects for The Shroud

== New Content ==

- New Ultimate Empath Avatar: Gaia Empath (Newerth Day)
* Gaia is the mother of Newerth; the ethereal, intangible spirit of the world made flesh, and a manifestation of the planet itself. She has seen the history of all people and places; reveled in its victories; and suffered with its strife. She has lived through wars and the initial Fall of Man which brought about the realm of Newerth, regrowing that which was lost to blight and carelessness. With the opening of The Scar releasing an onslaught of demons whose only purpose is to gouge and injure their birthplace, Gaia must emerge to save them from themselves through pitiful destruction.

* Gaia's appearance changes based on her map location, the level of her abilities, and the items in her possession.

- Map Locations
* In rivers and pools, Newerth's naturally occurring underwater crystals compose Gaia's water form.
* In lanes and bases, the tough terrain allows Gaia to construct her durable rock form.
* In the Legion jungle, Gaia adapts to the natural flora and assumes her grass form.
* In the Hellbourne jungle, the desolation gives life only to destruction, where Gaia manifests as fire.

- Items
* Striders will alter the path Gaia leaves behind her, depending on which form she is currently in.
* Astrolabe will create layers of a rotating, mechanical astrolabe around her weapon.
* Abyssal Skull will replace the top of her staff with a large Abyssal Skull, granting lifesteal to her teammates.
* Tablet of Command will be worn around her waist for escaping or pulling enemies into unfortunate situations.

- Ability Levels
* At level 1 of any ability, Gaia's human form is not yet strong enough to absorb strength from Newerth.

- Essence Link
* Level 2-3: The color of the Essence Link transforms into the primary color of whichever form Gaia currently exists in. 
* Level 4: Gaia extracts the full essence of Newerth, as elements of rock, fire, water, or grass surround the Essence Link.

- Illusory Veil
* Level 2-3: The color of the Illusory Veil transforms into the primary color of whichever form Gaia currently exists in. 
* Level 4: The will of Newerth's survival comes to fruition, as elements of rock, fire, water, or grass surround the Illusory Veil.

- Synergy
* Level 2-3: Newerth's life force surrounds Gaia's feet, the Synergy establishing her connection to everyone and everything.
* Level 4: The vitality that swirls around Gaia becomes stronger and more apparent as the Synergy gains traction.

- As One
* Level 2-3: The blessings of Newerth envelop Gaia with a whirlpool of energy as she protects her host.


- The eternal battle between Pirates and Ninjas has spread to Newerth! The boisterous, booty-seeking swashbucklers of The Bloodtide Brigade have dropped anchor to face the silent, mystical assassins of The Shroud, and both sides are recruiting for the ensuing clash. Which will you choose, cutlass or cutthroat? Flasks or masks? Pirates or Ninjas?

* Once you own the entire set of The Bloodtide Brigade or The Shroud, not only will you become an official member of the group, you'll also get extra booty!
* The Bloodtide Brigade: Each member of the set gains extra effects and you will be awarded the Pirate Announcer Pack for free
* The Shroud: Each member of the set gains extra effects and you will be awarded the Ninja Announcer Pack for free


- New Artesia Avatar: Corsair Artesia (Bloodtide Brigade)
* Dogmatic and efficient, Corsair Artesia hides her contempt for the callous Captain Gorebeard under a guise of strict order and rigid planning. Prior to Captain Baraacko's capture, she was given much more flexibility as part of the commanding officers, but after he was taken prisoner by the Legion, she was resigned to a more submissive position with fewer rewards for her work. She has plans to usurp the new captain if she can convince the crew to mutiny, but even getting them to mop the decks is a challenge, so she waits, placidly and patiently, for the perfect time to strike.

- New Puppet Master Avatar: Effigy Puppet Master (The Shroud)
* Effigy is a master of the darkest magic known to the mystical Shroud assassins. He is called upon when an untraceable kill is required, for his wizardry attacks the very essence of his targets and leaves no mark upon the flesh. Even more insidious is his ability to control members of the target's camp and force comrades to kill each other, leaving not only a larger body count but also inciting chaos and discord.

- New Rhapsody Avatar: Rhapscallion Rhapsody (Bloodtide Brigade)
* Once a scribe aboard Captain Baaracko's ship, Rhapscallion and her fellow deckhands became governed by fear when the gluttonous Gorebeard rose to the position of de facto leader on the vessel. Acting out and singing loudly as a means to mask her melancholy aboard the newly overtaken ship, she spends less time writing and more time dancing, secretly hoping the big red monster is taken out of commission by an unruly village or a Legion troop.

- New Circe Avatar: Veil Circe (The Shroud)
* Veil is the first member of the Shroud assassins to lay eyes on the next target. Her ability to change her appearance and expertly mimic any man, beast or daemon allows her to slip deep behind enemy lines and infiltrate even the most heavily defended areas. If she can get a clean kill immediately she will not hesitate. If not, she uses her abilities to help the other members of The Shroud surround the target, each of them closing in, lurking and waiting for the opportunity to strike.

- New Witch Slayer Avatar: Partisan Witch Slayer (Russian Victory Day)
* Partisans are fierce resistance fighters struggling against an occupying foreign army, and in the case of Partisan Witch Slayer, that foreign army happens to come from the Scar and consists of daemons, lords of the dead, and testy Archaic Gods. She certainly has her hands full, but she plans on celebrating Russian Victory Day by putting her trusty saperka entrenching tool and sniper rifle to good use.

- New Jeraziah Avatar: Liberator Jeraziah (Russian Victory Day)
* The valiant Liberator, released in honor of Russian Victory Day, fully embodies his mission of defending the innocent civilians ravaged by the war against the Hellbourne. No matter how weary or injured, he will forsake his own life and gladly stand in front of the defenseless, cover them with his shield and lift his broadsword toward the advancing daemon soldiers. To those who seek to harm those under his protection: Your bodies will build the foundation for new hope.

- New Rampage Avatar: Road Rage Rampage
* Didn't use your turn signal? That's a beating. Litter out the window? Goodbye side mirror. If you're sharing a lane with this temperamental rubber burner, mind your manners, call missing, and don't even think about kill stealing, and you might make it out with your grille intact. But rage is rarely logical, so it's probably best to just stay out of his way.

- New Fayde Avatar: POG Fayde (POGS)
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

-  Added Glowing Pink Name Color

Version 3.4.1

== New Content ==

- New Pollywog Priest Avatar: Axolotl Pollywog (Guardians of Newerth)
* The eccentric Axolotl Priest is a deadly hunter and callous enemy, reigning from the northern regions of the Rulian Marsh. Often trading rare plants and potions to the local troll hunters in exchange for gold and weaponry, he spends his time perfecting lethal poisons and coating his modified spearheads with the toxins. He is difficult to find amidst the thick jungle leaves, and by the time his shiny coat has been spotted, the enemy is already long lost to the marsh.

- New Chipper Avatar: Arctic Harrier
* The chiprels of Caldavar have been battered onto the endangered species list, and the time has come to call in their mad genius cousins: the Arctic Harriers. These bombastic carrot-munchers stomp onto the battlefield from the harsh northern Frost Fields, where the only heat comes from rocket trails and keeping your saw blade sharp can mean the difference between life and getting turned into a fur hat. The chiprels might regret this drastic measure, though-these Arctic Harriers aren't afraid to break a few tectonic plates to make sure they win a fight.

- New Armadon Avatar: Horny Lizardon (Guardians of Newerth)
* The shifting sands of The Great Waste have provided little nourishment or foundation for the animals and structures that resided in them, save for the hardiest plants and reptilian beasts that were able to reserve water in their bodies. This was fine for Horny Lizardon, a peacemaker and lonesome defender. However, the underground explosions and eruptions from The Scar, north of the deserts, which shook the earth and engulfed the citizens with lava spills were enough to provoke the spiky guardian into action against the daemons responsible.

- New Amun-Ra Avatar: Acolyte Amun-Ra
* Acolyte was a devoted student of Juna, the Sister of Sol whose brother Jaru betrayed their god and the Legion in return for Hellbourne immortality and power. Acolyte assisted Juna through many sessions in which they prayed for Jaru's redemption, reaching out to salvage his tainted soul. Jaru knew this, felt it, and with each session he offered Acolyte another glimpse of what she could gain by selling her soul. Soon she was utterly corrupted. She stole many priceless, powerful relics and volumes of magic known only to the Sisters of Sol and carried them to Jaru's feet, where she has knelt ever since. She is his most devoted disciple, and most deadly. She seeks to raise more evil entities like Amun-Ra, just as the Corrupted Disciples did.

- New Monarch Avatar: Cherub Monarch
* When the 7 Virtues were sent by Sol to aid Jeraziah in his crusade against the daemons spilling from Hell's Keep, the Cherubim came along with them to act as a protector class for the holy warriors as they did battle. Standing tall, through short of stature, they guarded the Virtues with protective magic and cleansing spells, allowing them to tear through regiments the Hellbourne beasts without worry about their wellbeing.

- New Electrician Avatar: Electrician (POG)
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

Version 3.4 - The Rising Tide
-------------
== General ==

- Added new Hero: Riptide
* The new Hellbourne strength hero Riptide is an ancient elemental from the bedrock of what became Caldavar. He has emerged from the primordial deep of the Inner Sea, manifesting the enormous power of the cold, black tides that once covered all of Newerth. Our advice: learn to swim.

- Riptide Ability 1: Watery Grave
* Riptide sends out a fierce, concentrated blast of water that damages and silences his enemies
* Target a unit to deal 60, 120, 180, 240 Magic Damage and Silence it for 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 seconds
* If the target is on water:
* It is Slowed by 50% for 3.5 seconds
* The Silence is increased to 2.5,3,3.5,4 seconds
* The Damage is increased to 80, 160, 240, 320

- Riptide Ability 2: Undertow
* Riptide unleashes a massive tidal wave to drench all his foes
* Target a location to unleash a tidal wave that deals 125 Magic Damage to all enemies hit. The wave leaves behind 250 radius puddles that give Riptide his "In my Element" buff
* If Riptide has his Ultimate active then the puddles will also slow Movement Speed by 30% for every enemy inside

- Riptide Ability 3: In My Element
* While in water, Riptide gains special bonuses by absorbing the element which gives him life
* Riptide gains the following buffs while on water:
* Attack Speed: 30, 40, 50, 60
* Move Speed: 5, 10, 15, 20%
* Attack Damage: 15, 30, 45, 60
* Invisibility unless he is within 450 radius of an enemy hero
* This buff will linger for 1 second once you are off water

- Riptide Ability 4: Perfect Storm
* Riptide calls down a powerful storm from the skies to drown Newerth while his own power increases
* The entire map is covered in water for 30, 50, 70 seconds, allowing Riptide to receive all his "In My Element" buffs
* All puddles now become "Deep Puddles" and anyone who is inside them is slowed by 30%
* All enemies are considered on water and will get the extended Silence and Slow by "Watery Grave"

- Added new Riptide Debut Edition Alt Avatar: Toxin
* There are areas of Newerth even the bravest heroes will not enter-vast expanses of wasteland seething with the pollution of the Lost Civilization, tainted by the tortured souls entombed within the virulent sludge. Now this mire has stirred, coalesced into Toxin, a living embodiment of the foul desecration of nature. He has trudged from the black ooze of the wastelands into Caldavar with the desire to taint everything he touches and leave a swath of infected land and water behind.

- Added new Riptide Premium Alt Avatar: WaterFest
* The Songkran Water Festival is upon us, and we're ready to cool off and celebrate the New Year by showering the map with water, flowers, and talc! WaterFest leads the blessing of Newerth with beautiful blossom armor and a body coursing with clear blue water, and when he steps into the soothing currents of Caldavar his festive nature grows even larger!


Camera Zoom Distance
+ We've allowed the maximum camera zoom distance to be increased, largely as a quality of life change, to allow players a more valid response to heroes that initiate from off-screen.  We are aware that this increases our system requirements and will be keeping a close eye on this change.
- The default and maximum ingame Camera Distance has been increased from 1,650 to 1,850 units

Hero Kill Gold changes
+ The formula for gold distribution was largely favoring grouping in the earlier stages of the game. Kills involving 4-5 heroes often resulted in double the amount of team gold compared to a single participant. The primary incentive for grouping should be completing team objectives, not hunting for heroes.
- Proximity Hero kill gold lowered from 30+5 per level to 0+7 per level

Lane Creeps
+ Increasing the relevance of the ranged barracks much sooner in the game. Teams will notice a much greater lane progression when destroying only the ranged rax as opposed to the melee.
- Fifth melee creep spawns at 44 minutes instead of 33 minutes
- Doubled ranged creeps spawn at 33 minutes instead of 45 minutes

Neutral Creeps
+ We've found that the Jungle was giving too much gold and experience relative to lanes. Often times the primary source of income on the map, it became mandatory to farm, which, because of its safety, promoted passive play. The efficiency of the Jungle has been reevaluated reducing the potential benefits. To compensate for the gold and experience reduction, we've reduced the damage neutrals deal to heroes and increased the yield of the easy camp to speed up the early game efficiency of junglers that do not have immediate access to the strong camps.
- The positions of the north-east most Legion Medium and Strong camps have been swapped
- Lane creeps will now aggro neutrals outside of only the pull camp
- Vagabonds have been moved from the medium camp to the small camp
* Commonly Referred to as "Double Pulling"
- Easy Camp: Experience increased by 15% & Gold increased by 10%
- Medium Camp: Experience decreased by 15%
- Hard Camp: Experience decreased by 15% & Gold decreased by 10%
- Ancients: Experience increased by 15% & Gold decreased by 20%
- Damage Uncontrolled Neutrals deal to Heroes reduced from 75% to 50%

- Ebulas have been moved from the small camp to the medium camp with a new neutral: Pustula
* Pustula has the Kamikaze ability. Kamikaze causes the Pustula to explode, leaving a goo on that ground that slows enemies

- Replaced the Minotaur Medium Camp with 2 Antlore Archers, 1 Antlore Healer, and a new neutral: Antlore Necromancer
* Antlore Necromancer has the Raise Dead ability, summoning Zomblings

- Werebeast Enchanter now has the Far Sight ability, usable when controlled by players
* Far Sight grants vision of an area for a brief duration

- Replaced a Fire Ogre with a new neutral: Alchemist Ogre
* Alchemist Ogre has the Transmute ability. Transmute instantly destroys another non hero unit

Towers
+ Towers have been tweaked to keep some late game relevance by implementing armor penetration. We've also reduced the damage received from melee summoned minions and player controlled neutrals to allow for better response time against heavy minion lineups.
- Tower attacks now pierce 25% of all Armor
- Summoned Melee units damage multiplier against Towers lowered from 70% to 50% (does not affect lane creeps)
- Player-Controlled Neutrals damage multiplier against Towers lowered from 70% to 50%

The following heroes and items will be added to Tournament Rules
- Klanx
- Ioyn Stone
- Spellsunder


== Hero Reworks ==

Cthulhuphant
+ The goal of this rework is two fold. We wanted to shift Cthulhuphant farther into an initiator role that can cause a lot of chaos in the mix of a team fight. On top of that we realized that we had an opportunity to take advantage of the great theme and lore of this hero to bring you all something truly terrifying......mwhahahaha!

Trample
- Launch distance increased from 600 to 900 units
- Stun duration of targets hit by creeps increased from 1 second to 1.75 seconds
- Damage increased from each minion hit from 10/15/20/25 to 15/20/25/30

Hook Em
- Shield HP value from 40/60/80/100 % of target's max HP to 50/100/150/200 + 10/20/30/40 % of target's max HP
- Now applies a shield in front of Cthulhuphant that pulses damage in a 400 radius cone in front of Cthulhuphant
- The damage done is 15/20/25/30 every pulse to every non hero unit and 25/30/35/40 damage to all hero units
- Duration lowered from 30 seconds to 25 seconds

Mortifying Presence renamed to Dream of Madness
- Activate to start an Aura that covers a 1000 radius from Cthulhuphant. Anyone inside this aura that faces Cthulhuphant will receive stacks of Madness. When they reach 4 stacks of Madness they go insane and begin to attack the nearest unit to them for 1/1.5/2/2.5
- 2 Charges are removed per second whenever looking away from Cthulhuphant
- Anyone within a 400 radius of Cthulhuphant are so scared they move 15% slower and attack 10% slower

Obliterate
- Duration increased from 4 to 5 seconds
- Damage of the ultimate starts lower and increases after each pulse
- Damage increased from 400/600/800 to 490/690/900
* Level 1: First pulse does 30 magic damage + 20 damage per additional pulse, capping at 130 damage
* Level 2: First pulse does 40 magic damage + 30 damage per additional pulse, capping at 190 damage
* Level 3: First pulse does 50 magic damage + 40 damage per additional pulse, capping at 250 damage


Shadowblade
+ Shadowblade has a "choose your play-style" fun that a lot of people have come to enjoy. With the following changes, we wanted to give you that feeling a bit more while also making the ultimate less tedious to use. Staff of the Master is also an excellent idea for a hero that is looking to build stats so we took the opportunity to give him a staff that added a lot to his customizing power.

Gargantuan's Blast
- Duration increased from 11 seconds to 15 seconds

Feint's Siphon
- Duration increased from 11 seconds to 15 seconds

Soul's Sight
- Duration increased from 11 seconds to 15 seconds

Essence Shift
- Mana cost lowered from 60 to 30
- Cast range has been increased from 800 to 1600
- You now take the primary stat of whatever form you are in when using the ultimate on yourself
- No longer interrupts movement on cast
- Can now be boosted by Staff of the Master

Staff of the Master Boost Effect
- Essence Shift: Cooldown lowered from 30 seconds to 5 seconds
- Essence Shift: While in Strength form, you get 60/80/100% Cleave
- Essence Shift: While in Agility form, you gain Unit Walking and True Strike
- Essence Shift: While in Intelligence form, all your attacks drain mana from your target equal to 80% of your Intelligence


Silhouette
+ Silhouette is an amazing hero with a ton of synergy, however a lot of that synergy was being held back because she was a 600 range semi-carry. In order to compensate for her range, the power of her abilities had to be continuously lowered until she fell out of favor completely. This was not an intended goal and we felt a rework that lowered her attack range and put a solid emphasis on the synergy of her abilities would allow for her to shine.

- Attack Range lowered from 600 to 350
- Intelligence increased from 18 to 23
- intelligence per level increased from 1.7 to 2
- Turn Rate increased from 360 to 450

Death Lotus
- Mana cost lowered from 85/95/105/115 to 85/90/95/100
- Blade rotation speed increased from 90 degrees/second to 135 degrees/second

Tree Grapple
- Cast range rescaled from 1200 to 1000/1150/1300/1450
- Cast Action Time lowered from 0.2s to 0.15s
- Cooldown decreased from 16 seconds to 19/15/11/7 seconds
- Mana cost from 120 to 120/105/90/75
- Stun duration decreased from 1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds to 1 second
- Log Bolas now costs 25/50/75/100 mana to cast
- Silhouette is no longer disarmed while traveling in Sky Dance

Relentless Salvo
- Cooldown decreased from 4 seconds to 4.5/3.5/2.5/1.5 seconds
- Attack speed bonus increased from 150/200/250/300 to 400
- Damage increased to 4/7/10/13 per stack
- Relentless Salvo enemy state duration increased from 3 seconds to 10 seconds
- Charge limit on the Relentless Salvo enemy state increased from 5 to 15
* Translates to an increase in damage cap from 15/30/45/60 to 60/105/150/195 physical damage at max charges
- Illusions add charges onto enemies with the Relentless Salvo state, but will not deal bonus physical damage based on the charges

Shadow
- Cast Action Time decreased from 0.3s to 0.25s
- Cooldown decreased from 120/110/100 seconds to 80 seconds
- Mana cost decreased from 150 to 150/100/50
- Duration of illusion increased from 15/25/35 seconds to 20/30/40 seconds
- Illusion's damage received multiplier decreased from 200% to 200/150/100%
- Illusion's damage dealt multiplier increased from 66% to 100%
- Swap sub ability cooldown decreased from 10 seconds to 8/6/4 seconds
- Swap sub ability mana cost decreased from 50 to 50/25/0


== Heroes ==

Artillery
+ The previous change to Artillery reduced the excessive flash farming capabilities of the hero. We are now focusing on adjusting the power and difficulty of LRM making it much more reliable in combat.
- LRM: Touch radius increased from 40 to 60
- LRM: Lifetime lowered from 800 to 600 (reaches its max distance sooner)
- LRM: Mana Cost lowered from 80/90/100/110 to 70/80/90/100

Bombardier
+ Adding to Bombardier's utility kit allows for some creativity with his team. Bombardier may now attach his Sticky Bomb to an ally for some clever team combinations. Bombardment will also deal a portion of it's damage to buildings to assist with his long range sieging and harassment capabilities.
- Sticky Bomb: Can now attach to allies
- Bombardment: Now deals 33% damage to buildings
- Sticky Bomb: Cooldown lowered from 17/16/15/14 to 14 seconds at all levels
- Boom Dust: Charge refresh lowered from 10/8/6/4 to 4

Bubbles
+ We've increased the cooldown of Kelp Field at the earlier levels. Before, Bubbles has had a significant power spike when first hitting level 6, which made him extremely valuable even when underleveled.  Now, he is not able to forfeit lanes as comfortably.
- Kelp Field: Cooldown increased from 85 to 115/100/85

Chronos
+ We are happy with the concept of Curse of Ages being usable in ganking scenarios. However, we have found that the timer was far too short, which allowed for frequent use in lane scenarios.
- Curse of ages: Automatic countdown timer increased from 5 seconds to 9 seconds

Demented Shaman
+ Mostly a quality of life improvement, the change for the Demented Shaman helps stop dramatic heroics from turning into awkward moments.
- Unbreakable: Projectile Speed increased from 800 to 1200
- Unbreakable: Cast time lowered from 300 to 150

Devourer
+ Skillful Self Denies can provide satisfaction from both sides. The lack of input and counter-play from Decay, however, made it unpredictable and random, especially in the scenarios of multiple enemies attacking him. We've added a small window that will prevent the lethal damage from Decay if the Devourer has taken damage from another player recently. This will add a more interesting skill dynamic requiring the Devourer to juke and avoid damage while also creating more tension for the enemy to keep him in combat.
- Decay: Can no longer self deny within one second of taking damage from another player

Electrician
+ Offering more to his utility kit, we wanted to reward the Electrician's iconic offensive and defensive dispel by significantly reducing the cooldown.
- Cleansing shock: Cooldown lowered from 16/12/8 to 12/8/4

Emerald Warden
+ Offering more to Emerald Warden's utility kit. Emerald Warden will now be more proficient at scouting enemies and countering stealth.
- Hunter's Command: Now applies sighted and revealed to the targets for the duration of the slow

Flux
+ Magnetic Surge's cast time has been cut in half to reduce some of the awkwardness when following up with an auto attack or Release. Flux's input flow will feel much more fluid.
- Magnetic Surge: Cast time lowered from 400 to 200

Geomancer
+ Geomancer's Dig range has been increased at the earlier levels, increasing his initiation capabilities in lane and when roaming.
- Dig: Range increased from 700/800/900/1000 to 1000

Grinex
+ Grinex is a very aggressive ganker in the earlier stages of the game giving good map control to a team. We are keeping this strength relevant to preserve our goals of hero diversity and toning down his late game potential instead to separate him more from his carry focused invisibility counterparts.
- Agility gain lowered from 2.8 to 1.8

Hammerstorm
+ Galvanize has had it's power increased at the later levels, offering more to Hammerstorm's team kit to combat Physical Damage. This will also offer a larger incentive to skill Galvanize over bonus attributes.
- Galvanize: Armor increased from 3/5/7/9 to 3/6/9/12
- Galvanize: Mana Cost lowered from 25 to 25/15/5/0
- Galvanize: Cooldown lowered from 36/30/24/18 to 36/28/20/12

Kraken
+ Kraken has an above average Movement Speed that allowed for some excessive gap closing. Combined with the utility of his abilities, it was often times difficult to avoid the Kraken's attacks. With a reduction to his Movespeed, it will be easier to kite the Kraken when you avoid his abilities.
- Base movespeed lowered from 310 to 300

Midas
+ We've swapped the cooldowns on Lion's Pride and Golden Salvo to bring back some of Midas's early game team fighting potential. Because of the difficulty of achieving the maximum potential of Lion's Pride, the choice between skilling Lion's Pride versus Golden Salvo was too limited. 
- Lion's Pride: Cooldown reduced by 5 seconds
- Golden Salvo: Cooldown increased by 5 seconds

Moon Queen
+ Moon Queen is a hero that gains a large amount of free damage from her abilities which allows her to be effective even with a lack of combative items. We've toned down the damage from Moon Finale to reduce her team fight impact and ganking capabilities. The reduction in movement speed will also give enemies a more meaningful opportunity to avoid the full damage from Moon Finale.
- Base movespeed lowered from 320 to 310
- Moon Finale: Damage lowered from 300 to 275

Pestilence
+ We've found Pestilence to be proficient at too many roles. We want to keep his carry potential and chasing play style intact, so we've turned down some of his team fight and initiation impact instead. The stun duration of Impale has been reduced, most noticeably at the later levels. Swarm's Mana cost has also been increased, forcing Pestilence to be more considerate of his frequent use, especially in the earlier stages of the game.
- Impale: Stun duration lowered from 1/1.5/2.0/2.5 to 1/1.25/1.5/1.75 (Slow still only lasts for 2 seconds after the stun duration)
- Swarm: Mana Cost increased from 25 to 50

Pollywog Priest
+ The frog has received some mana decreases in his Tongue Tied and Voodoo Wards abilities to help alleviate some of the gold requirements for mana items. The reduced mana cost on Voodoo Wards will also allow for much earlier use of Restoration Stone in his end game build.
- Tongue Tied: Mana Cost lowered from 110/130/155/185 to 100/115/130/145
- Voodoo Wards: Mana Cost lowered from 200/350/600 to 200/350/500

Prisoner
+ One Man Riot has been reworked to be something a bit more interesting for the brute. One man Riot will now reach a higher peak of damage when Prisoner uses his abilities, while no longer granting free passive damage.
- Starting damage increased from 53-59 to 57-63
- One Man Riot: Reworked from 15/30/45/60% Base Damage to 15/20/25/30% Base damage for each of your abilities on cooldown

Revenant
+ We've lowered the Base Attack Time of Revenant to assist with his role of semi-carry and lane presence with Defile. Mortification will also prioritize enemies over self when duplicated with Manifestation removing the risk involved with achieving the damage potential.
- Base attack time lowered from 1.7 to 1.5
- Defile: Slow duration increased from 3 seconds to 4 seconds
- Mortification: Prioritizes enemies over self

Slither
+ Slither's attack has been lowered slightly. We wanted to keep Slither's strength against melee heroes relevant however his lane aggression against ranged heroes made him difficult to compete against. Slither will have a slightly increased risk when poking at enemies.
- Attack range lowered from 500 to 450

Solstice
+ To compensate for some of the jungle changes that reduced the overall gold yield. We've increased Solstice's creep clearing speed a bit.
- Solar Slash: Bonus damage to creeps increased from 75% to 100%
- Illuminate: No longer blocks neutral spawns

Valkyrie
+ Largely a quality of life change, Call of the Valkyrie will no longer be a randomized target.
- Call of the Valkyrie: second hit always targets closest instead of random

Vindicator
+ Between the duration and the cooldown, Glyph of Silence had an extremely small window for counter-play. We've reduced the uptime by increasing the cooldown.
- Glyph of Silence: Cooldown increased from 30 to 45

War Beast
+ To compensate for some of our jungle changes that reduced the overall gold yield, we've increased the early game damage of War Beast's Hellhounds.
- Hellhounds: Starting armor increased from 2 to 3
- Hellhounds: Damage increased from 24/32/40/48 to 30/35/40/45 


== Items == 

Token of Life
+ The token of life's excessive duration was allowing for extremely passive play from the holder. Killing Kongor should incentivize an engagement with the upper hand soon after the kill, not an extended protected net of safety.
- Duration lowered from 7 minutes to 5 minutes

Alchemist Bones
+ We feel that Alchemist Bones has far too limited use. With the reduction in gold values lowering the potential of the item, we felt this was an avenue to explore combative uses for Alchemist Bones.
- Can now target player controlled units

Courier
+ We've toned down the amount of hits it will take for summoned units to destroy the courier. Teams will still need to be considerate of their courier usage however the frequency of unresponsive courier deaths will be lowered.  We've also reduced the cost of replacing the courier.
- Summon Units damage to the courier lowered from 3 health per hit to 1 health per hit
- Ground Courier cost reduced from 200 to 100

Energizer
+ Energizer is promoting the fast paced action that we all enjoy, however we've found that teams are obtaining the item far too early for the amount of benefits it provides. We wanted to keep the impact of the activation of Energizer high, so we've reduced the buildup efficiency of the item and removed some of the passive benefits. We've also added a team activation cooldown similar to Astrolabe to prevent excessive stacking. We are aware that Energizer is a core item on some heroes and we will be watching them very closely.
- Old Buildup: Pretender's Crown(185) + Pretender's Crown(185) + Soulscream Ring(460) + Recipe(600) = 1430
- New Buildup: Major Totem(540) + Soulscream Ring(460) + Recipe(500) = 1500
- Removed Passive Move Speed
- Increased mana cost from 50 to 75
- Now has a team cooldown of 25 seconds (no stacking buffs)
- Reduced Recipie cost from 600 to 500

Icebrand
+ We've reworked the slow of Icebrand to be something much more noticeable earlier on. Icebrand previously took a maximum of 5 attacks to reach it's potential, which for most heroes wasn't realistic. It's upgraded forms have also been adjusted accordingly.
- Slow increased from 3% to 6%, maximum charges lowered from 5 to 2 (now slows up to 12%)

Frostburn and FrozenLight
- Slow increased from 5% to 6% (now slows up to 18%)

Dawnbringer
- Maximum number of Chilled charges increased from 3 to 4 (now slows up to 24%)

Icon of the Goddess
+ Icon of the Goddess is filling it's role as a snowball item. However we are uncomfortable with the impact of the burst healing and regeneration making it extremely difficult to kill enemies under the effects. We wanted to maintain the high impact so we've increased the amount of time it takes to receive the same health and mana.
- Health and Mana regeneration state lowered from 30 per second to 20 per second
- Health and Mana regeneration state duration increased from 10 seconds to 15 seconds

Iron Buckler
+ Iron Buckler is extremely frustrating to lane against for ranged heroes with inherently lower damage than melee. We want harassment progression to be noticeable so we've toned down the damage reduction amount. To compensate we've also lowered the cost to allow for more interesting starting build diversity.
- Block amount lowered from 20 to 15
- Cost lowered from 250 to 225

Striders
+ To alleviate some of the downtime from roaming, reducing some of the frequent fountain trips for supports and roamers, we've added some health regeneration while under the benefits of the Movement Speed bonus.
- Now grant 2 HP regen passively while you have charges


== Bots ==

- Easy difficulty bots now take more creep damage before retreating
* This also gives players more opportunity to harass them
- Fixed an issue with teambots with no heroes


== New Content ==

- Added new Sand Wraith Alt Avatar: Blight Wraith
* The Blight Wraith is a once-beautiful woman who has been infected and corrupted by her desire to supplant Gaia as the true mother of Newerth. Her goal is to reduce all of Newerth to a barren wasteland so she may rebuild it in her vision, which unfortunately for all living things looks a lot like a barren wasteland.

- Added new Glacius Alt Avatar: Nuclear Glacius
* Nuclear Winter Glacius is rumored to be a power-hungry wizard who traveled alone to the blasted lands beyond the Frost Fields, a region so ravaged by the nuclear wars that ended the Lost Civilization that no living creature has ventured in and survived more than a day. He sought the forgotten magic of mankind that allowed them to harness energy from the tiniest particles and transform it into destructive power that could level a city-even a civilization. Now he carries the power of that destruction within him, and he is well aware of the irony that it is the only thing keeping his ruined shell of a body alive.

- Added new Klanx Alt Avatar: Safari Klanx
* No region of Newerth is safe when Safari Klanx is on the prowl. Armed to the teeth with various weapons and traps (one of which is carried by his involuntary pack-elephant (or packÂ­yderm)), the overconfident "sportsman" takes great pride in ending the lives of those weaker than himself. From the sticky Rulian Marsh, to the chilly Frost Fields, the to barren Savannahs, the ultimate hunter has his mind on trophy heads and victory. Once he finds the trail of his prey, there is no escape, no matter where on Newerth they roam.

- Added new Master of Arms Alt Avatar: Songkran Master of Arms
* Master of Arms is all decked out in his Songkran gear, and nobody can protect themselves from the party he is about to unload. Armed to the teeth with water balloons, bottles, and spray guns, this competitive badboy is ready to soak all the ladies with his blaster.

- Added new Rampage Alt Avatar: Songkran Rampage
* Nobody celebrates the Water Festival better than Songkran Rampage! For the duration of the holiday (and the rest of the year) he's joyously burning rubber, blessing everyone with his water jug and gathering partygoers together with his chain of flowers. You're getting dragged into the Songkran Water Festival whether you like it or not!

- Added new Night Hound Holiday Avatar: Rabid Night Bunny
* Easter is right around the corner, but before you go looking for eggs on the ground, you may want to watch your back! The Rabid Night Bunny is a fearsome protector of all things small and colorful, emerging from his secret lair once a year to scare curious children who might get their greedy little hands on his precious trinkets. He may look cute, but this bunny has no qualms about cracking your head wide open and feasting on the cream filling.

- Added new Keeper of the Forest Alt Avatar: Keeper of the Green
* Hailing from the steamy southern regions of the Rulian Marsh, beyond the grasp of the rotten vines and vile parasites, where the sun shines longer and the trees grow fuller without the strife of battle, Keeper of the Green lays back and watches the time fly. His fists are chipped from exploration of the environment and of his mind, but he takes it all in stride. After all, when one lives as long as he does, you learn not to sweat the small stuff, only the sun high over the treetops.

- Added new Cthulhuphant Alt Avatar: Caller Cthulhuphant
* Awoken from his eternal slumber in the lost city of R'lyeh, the tentacled monstrosity known as The Caller rises from the depths to wreak havoc on the mortals of Newerth. Constant battle and strife has finally shaken the waters enough to rouse the mythical beast and, with great disdain, the powerful ancient of ancients trudges beyond the ocean floor to vanquish the disturbances. Calling from the edge of the universe and beckoning the living from beyond time, Newerth may be destroyed by the grotesque titan before either side of the war gets a chance to reclaim it.

- New Wretched Hag Avatar: Baba Yaga
* Not much is known of Baba Yaga, the kooky old woman who lives on the edge of the Legion's eastern forests. Legend has it she flies around in a large mortar, killing people who have wandered too far into her domain and collecting their heads to sustain her longevity. Her magic broom, it is said, is used to erase evidence of her crimes, and her dilapidated home is a sentient hut with chicken legs. But nobody really believes any of those ridiculous rumors. Nobody who has lived to tell the tale, anyway...

- New Voodoo Jester Avatar: RagnarÃ¶k Hel Skin
* In her brief and brutal time on Newerth, Hel has realized the land of the living is truly on the verge of RagnarÃ¶k, the great battle that will result in the death of many powerful gods, including Odin, Thor, TÃ½r, and Loki. She has adorned herself with the proper attire and weaponry to begin the battle, as well as welcome her new guests to the realm of the dead.

- New Demented Shaman Avatar: Battle Armor Athena
* The ancient pantheons and archaic gods are growing stronger as heroes of the Legion lose faith in their god Sol. Now many of the warriors pray to Athena, companion to heroes and goddess of righteous warfare. She has answered their pleas, stepping into the ranks among them and becoming the embodiment of heroic inspiration.

- New Legionnaire Avatar: Boudica
* This fierce female warlord of the savage tribes beyond Grimm's Crossing has had enough. The Hellbourne generals have sent wave after wave of daemons to claim her land, slaughter her people, and burn her crops. After years of defending her homeland, Boudica has realized she must take the fight to the enemy. She can be found at the front of any battle, calling the cursed enemy to come and fight her, for she knows that will bring a swifter end to the war.

- New Flint Beastwood Avatar: Flinty Widowmaker
* Flint Beastwood's lethal twin sister Flinty Widowmaker left her brother's side years ago, eschewing the family's obsolete attachment to ancient heirloom weaponry and embracing the most modern tools of killing she could find. She operated behind the scenes for years as a spy, but now that the Legion and Hellbourne are paying more for assassinations than information, she has put her lethal skills on the market for the highest bidder.

- New Succubus Avatar: POGs Succubus
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- New Scout Avatar: Scoutzo the Clown
* Hey, kids! Ever feel like your games are just a joke? Wanna teach those "pros" how much fun ganking can be? Stop clownin' around and pick up your very own Scoutzo avatar, straight outta' Caldavar's own Traveling Big Top Circus! This wacky fellow will have them dying of laughter before they even see him! Time to get silly!

- Added new Announcer: Na Khom Announcer
* Have a laugh with Na Khom while dominating your opponents!
* Voiced by Na Khom, a comedian from Thailand

== New Content ==

- Added new Nymphora Holiday Avatar: Luckphora
* Luckphora is rarely seen in Newerth, and when she makes an appearance it always bodes well for her team. She is renowned for spreading good health, good times, and good luck-if you treat her nicely.

- Added new Defiler Avatar: Chaos Realm Kali
* Fighting for the Hellbourne has its perks: free blood, a strong leader, and no need for moral capacity. Chaos Realm Kali is spawned from the chaotic energy that lies deep in the heart of Hell's Keep, untapped by any of the daemons with enough mental stability to have a battle plan, and augmenting the abilities of those who long for nothing but destruction and confusion. Using the goddess of death as a most appropriate host, the spirit of Chaos embodies Kali and uses her power to spread itself over the land, raining blood on the living for no reason other than nobody can stop it.

- Added new Ellonia Alt Avatar: Cursed Woodpuppet
* Legionnaires will often carve woodpuppets for use in practice battles by cutting down trees outside the castle training yard; however, when far from home, these fierce fighters will make do with whatever shrubbery is nearby. Cursed Woodpuppets are any of several dozen test dummies that were left by Legionnaires on excursions to Hellbourne territory. Possessing the same body structure as a zombie, but without the same weaknesses, these creepy dolls were invigorated with life by Hellbourne Voodoo Jesters, under the command of their malevolent leaders to slaughter the Legion soldiers who so callously used them as toys.

- Added new Hellbringer Alt Avatar: Jade Empress
* The Jade Empress is the matriarch of the Sang-La region, out of touch with the working class and generally much too busy amassing wealth and knowledge to govern with any method but fear. Her desire for power and access to ancient secrets of the eastern sorcerers have guided her to studying the dark arts, her crowning achievement being the potential to summon a large monster under her control. This is the main threat the people face should they decide to rise up.

- Added new Sir Benzington Alt Avatar: Drop Bearzington
* Just in time for the Finals of the Australian Seasonal, Drop Bearzington is fed up with all these so-called heroes tearing up his precious forest and he means to do something about it. Legion and Hellbourne warriors alike-especially the foreigners-can try spreading Vegemite behind their ears and put forks in their hair, but it won't matter. It's Drop Bear time, mate.. 

- Added new Corrupted Disciple Alt Avatar: Loki
* As punishment for killing the god Baldr, Loki was shackled to a boulder for centuries, where the venom from a serpent dripped onto his face and caused earthquakes as Loki convulsed. The gods imprisoned Loki until RagnarÃ¶k, the great battle foretold to result in natural disasters, the flooding of the world, and the death of many ancient gods. The appearance of Loki on the battlefield has many believing the war between the Legion and Hellbourne has brought about the world-killing RagnarÃ¶k...and that's just the way Loki likes it.

- Added new Gunblade Alt Avatar: TÃ½r
* The one-handed Norse god of law and heroic glory has been drawn to Newerth by the belief that the battle between the Legion and Hellbourne is the arrival of RagnarÃ¶k, the great battle that will end all things. TÃ½r believes his courage and harsh justice will bring a halt to the inevitable destruction of the world, and he is prepared to kill everyone to make it so.

- Added new Drunken Master Alt Avatar: Mead Viking Dionysus
* It is the season for the god Dionysus to be reborn on Newerth, and through the ages he has seen no warriors who revel in the nectar of the gods as much as the Vikings. He descends in his Viking kit with overflowing pots and mugs of mead for friend and foe alike. Viking Dionysus believes if he can get everyone on Newerth to drink his honey wine, the wars will soon end, everyone will rejoice in ecstasy, and the land will be reborn in its natural state of peace. Sounds pretty good, even if it doesn't work.

- Added new Night Hound Alt Avatar: POG Night Hound
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

== New Content ==

- Added new Maliken Ultimate Avatar: Humility
* Maliken Grimm has been the savior and the scourge of mankind, so powerful in his daemonic power that the Blind Prophet had to summon the Five Disciples and the Virtues to bring him back to Sol's flock. But one must wonder--is Maliken truly redeemed, or is this a ploy to gain access to the very heart of the Legion, his flesh and blood, Jeraziah and Ophelia?

- Added new Plague Rider Alt Avatar: Pegasus
* Many worshippers of Zeus and the Greek gods believe the creatures from the Rift are reincarnations of mythological monsters like the Chimera. The brave and loyal warriors Pegasus and Bellerophon have been summoned from Mt. Olympus to battle these creatures and the Hellbourne, on land and in the skies!

- Added new Tundra Alt Avatar: Allfather Odin
* As the Archaic Gods clamor for power and influence among the warriors of Newerth, Odin has sat upon his steed Sleipnir and felt oddly removed from it all. The revelation came when he witnessed King Jeraziah leading an attack of skirmishers in the blessed armor of the Disciple Omen. Of course! What leader can hope to gain respect when he is so removed from his soldiers? Odin immediately found a suitable stable for Sleipnir and strode to the battlefield in his footsoldier armor, prepared to demonstrate what the Allfather of the gods could do face-to-face.

- Added new Gravekeeper Alt Avatar: Hestia
* Lured from her place in Olympus by the chaos of the Hellbourne, Hestia descends to restore faith and order to the Legion as they battle that which threatens their health and home. In her anger, Hestia calls upon the power of the hearth to ignite her enemies in shrouds of fire and surround them with the burning spirits of their ancestors.

- Added new Gladiator Alt Avatar: Halcyon Judicator
* The Halcyon Judicator is a noble, albeit contentious, authority figure, whose desire for ultimate honor and justice often ironically clouds his judgment. He has no patience for those who break his idea of the law, even if their intentions are pure or there are reasons behind their actions. He seeks to be the judge, jury, and executioner of criminals, taking orders from no one and punishing victims in ways he deems fit, without the consent of anyone else.

- Added new Hammerstorm Alt Avatar: Hercules
* Hera still holds a grudge against Zeus's illegitimate son Hercules, and she has guided the Oracle of Delphi to add a thirteenth labor to the legendary hero's list: travel to Newerth and rid that world of the Hellbourne. When Hercules heard this command, he hefted his massive club and cheered at the prospect of fighting alongside his father and sending daemons back to the underworld.

- Added new Thunderbringer Alt Avatar: Asgard Thor
* Just as his father deemed to walk among the Legion soldiers as an equal, Thor decided his common, barbaric appearance was robbing him of respect and adulation. He returned to Asgard and chose his finest armor, polished to a blinding brightness, and rejoined his loyal troops wearing battle garb worthy of a god.

- Added new Midas Alt Avatar: Coral Snake Medusa
* Medusa has long sought revenge against Athena for transforming her into a hideous creature, and her gorgeous new warpaint signifies a fair warning to the goddess of so-called justice that she had better armor up when they next meet on Newerth.

- Added new Blacksmith Alt Avatar: POG Blacksmith
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

Version 3.3.3
-------------
== New Content ==

- Added new Prisoner Alt Avatar: Temperance
* The Sin of Gluttony is perhaps the most insidious, as even wanting too much Virtue for oneself can lead to a detour from Sol's light. The Codex Solaris states: "No virtue can be sustained if the seeker lacks self-control." These words of Sol force the embodiment of Temperance to walk a tightrope of self-restraint, honor, and abstention, clutching his own bonds in fists of rage. Even his control has limits, however, and when the injustice becomes too much to bear he shatters his restraints to bring the full force of Sol's vengeance upon his enemies.

- Added new Nomad Alt Avatar: Diligence
* Diligence is the 6th Virtue, representative of the continual striving of betterment through persistence and hard work. A general in Sol's army ravaged by heavenly battles, but determined to continue fighting at the call of the Blind Prophet, the spirit of Diligence embodied Newerth's Nomad, who found his way to Jeraziah's palace in Caldavar by following a divinely arranged trail of stars.

- Added new Electrician Alt Avatar: Osiris
* The merciful Osiris has watched all living beings of Newerth suffer during these endless wars, and he has concluded the only hope for mankind is to return to the land of the living and bring about a massive cleansing-a lethal flooding of life force-that will take man back to his origins so he may be reborn and begin anew.

- Added new Draconis Alt Avatar: Sphinx
* Since the beginning of time the World Tree has been protected by many guardians, each called forth by Gaia to combat the prevalent dangers. With the daemons stopping at nothing to destroy the Tree, Gaia is sending all of her forces to the front lines. The Sphinx once prowled with the haunches of a lion, the wings of a great bird, and the face of a human, but the current Hellbourne threat requires a significant upgrade. The haunches and hide have been reforged as impenetrable obsidian, the wings sheathed with armor, and the face transformed into a fierce creature who incinerates enemies of the World Tree with the energy of creation.

- Added new Doctor Repulsor Alt Avatar: Anunnaki Repulsor
* Believed to have built the pyramids before the creation of man (as a slave race for the gods), Annunaki Repulsor traverses the landscape in his pyramid-shaped spaceship, awing man and beast alike who have no concept of such a machine. Sensing disturbance after the fall of man, he descends from his throne in heaven only to find his race of human slaves being slaughtered by a new breed of demon summoned from a plane unknown to the collective of gods. Furious at the horde for attempting to overtake his creation, he vows to restore order by taking matters into his own hands.

- Added new Zephyr Alt Avatar: Horus
* Horus is the son of Isis and Osiris, previously known throughout the world as one of the most prominent Egyptian gods. In Newerth, he is reincarnated on the mortal plane as a large peregrine falcon, as he was often depicted in ancient Egypt. As master of the skies, and all that resides between Newerth and the heavens, he has control over the wind, and wields a tremendous amount of power as he flies over the new world, seeking followers to increase his diminished strength.

- Added new Andromeda Alt Avatar: Andromeda (POGS)
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

== Hero Balance ==

Berzerker
+ A quality of life improvement for the Berzerker. Mark for Death will now be usable while attacking and moving without interrupting your actions.
- Mark for Death: Cast time lowered from 100 to 0, no longer interrupts actions

Gemini
+  Elemental Force has had its armor penetration and movement speed benefits reduced. Gemini was being too heavily rewarded in his damage output for high durability strength builds. We want his Armor Penetration to be an option but we found that the power of it was leading to one dimensional peak output builds.
- Elemental Force: Strength required per Armor Penetration increased from 18,16,14,12 to 22,20,18,16
- Elemental Force: Agility required per Movement Speed increased from 5,4,3,2 to 6,5,4,3

Lord Salforis
+ We're pushing Salforis's concept of counter healing to be much more usable throughout the game. Mors Certissima's mana cost has been reduced but the healing portion has been increased, allowing for more sustainability when used in conjunction with Dark Lord's Presence. The Undying has had its cooldown, mana cost and damage significantly decreased. The Undying has always been intended to combat high regeneration and healing. With the large reduction in cooldown, Salforis will have it much more frequently for its team fight and ganking uses.
- Mors Certissima: Mana Cost lowered from 90,100,110,120 to 75,80,85,90
- Mors Certissima: Range increased from 500 to 600
- Mors Certissima: Cast action time lowered from 250 to 100
- Mors Certissima: Impact delay increased from 500 to 650
- Mors Certissima: Health Regeneration increased from 20% to 40%
- Undying: Cooldown lowered from 120,100,80 to 60,45,30
- Undying: Mana Cost lowered from 150,240,330 to 100,150,200
- Undying: Initial Damage removed, Damage per Second lowered from 30,50,70 to 25,40,55 (Total from 410,700,990 to 300,480,660).
- Undying (Staff of the Master): Duration increased from 12 seconds to 18 seconds.

Moon Queen
+ We feel that the large amount of free auxiliary damage that Moon Queen was receiving allowed her to build strictly defensive items making her extremely difficult to deal with in fights. We want there to be more of a decision when building offensive or defensive items so we've toned down some of her stats to also reduce the late game effectiveness of her aura and illusions.
- Agi gain lowered from 2.8 to 2.4
- Multi Strike: Damage reduction per bounce increased from 35,30,25,20% to 40,35,30,25%

The Chipper
+ The Chipper has received an additional benefit to Focus Buffer encouraging more selfless uses. Focus Buffer will now restore mana to The Chipper whenever damage is absorbed. We want The Chipper himself to experience the benefits of Focus Buffer when casting on allies, creating more incentive for teamwork.
- Focus Buffer: Restores half the damage absorb as mana to the Chipper.
- Focus Buffer: Cooldown lowered from 20 seconds to 15 seconds.

The Gladiator
+ Showdown has had its duration increased, lowering the harsh level requirement The Gladiator experiences in the early game to enjoy the combined uses of Pitfall and Showdown.
- Showdown: Duration increased from 1,2,3,4 to 2,3,4,5

Vindicator
+ Vindicator's concept of anti-caster is being emphasized. We've given him an increase to his utility that will help both his roles as carry and support. Brain Drain is getting a notable power increase stealing an increased amount of Int, limiting enemies' mana pools while also granting the Vindicator damage benefits. Glyph of Silence will now additionally slow and Perplex enemies when triggered, giving the Vindicator more defensive uses for clever placement and positioning. Lastly, Final Chapter will automatically trigger Glyph of Silence to enemies in range of the glyph, giving Vindicator an additional combat use for his ultimate.
- Brain Drain: Int drain increased from 3 to 3,4,5,6
- Brain Drain: Int drain duration increased from 25,30,35,40 to 30
- Brain Drain: Cooldown lowered from 15,12,9,6 to 12,10,8,6
- Brain Drain: Mana Cost increased from 70,90,110,130 to 70,95,120,145
- Glyph of Silence: Additionally applies a 50% tapering slow and perplex for the duration
- Glyph of Silence: Debuff duration increased from 1.5,2,2,2.5 to 1.5,2,2.5,3
- Glyph of Silence: Has received a visual upgrade
- Final Chapter: Applies the effects of Glyph of Silence to enemies in rage of the pedestal when Final Chapter is applied.

Version 3.3.2
-------------
== New Content ==

- Added new Chronos Alt Avatar: Patience
* The Blind Prophet continues his mission to rid Newerth of the Seven Deadly Sins, and when one is facing such an insidious enemy, one needs Patience. Patience is the embodiment of mercy and sufferance-he will gladly endure the scars of war upon his body and soul to give Man and Beast a chance at peace-but he realizes blood must be shed to achieve this end. He serves as the counter to the Sin Wrath, who kills out of anger and madness, while Patience destroys the physical vessels of daemons to free their damned souls, releasing them toward redemption.

- Added new Torturer Alt Avatar: Kindness
* Reveling in the joy that happiness brings, the redeemed virtue Kindness trades the intense invocations of pain for the sweet blessings of affection. A merciful young angel, Kindness sounds very caring, but can become passionate to the point of overlooking what people really want, sounding malicious despite her benevolence and forcing them to love each other when they have no desire to do so. 

- Added new Flux Alt Avatar: Jupiter
* The citizens of Newerth who worship the ancient god Jupiter feel their confidence build when they talk of how the mythological soldiers known as Romans defeated the Greeks, proving their gods were stronger. Their prayers and sacrifices have been answered, for now Jupiter has descended in full battle regalia to show once again what a true god of sky and thunder can do.

- Added new Tempest Alt Avatar: Poseidon
* Dwelling in the deepest, darkest parts of Newerth's oceans, where even the fiercest of land warriors and demons fear to venture, the god of the sea, Poseidon, rises from the depths. When his brothers Hades and Zeus returned to take back the earth after the Fall of Man, Poseidon knew they would conspire to steal his watery domain as well, reigning over the largest section of Newerth while he sat dethroned and on the run.

- Added new Artillery Alt Avatar: Apollo
* So who's this Sol chump claiming to be the god of light and fire? Apollo has been bringing the heat for thousands of years, as well as truth, prophecy, healing, plague, poetry, and beautiful music played on a lyre made by Hermes himself. Anyone who picks Sol over such a superstar must be Blind.

- Added new Accursed Alt Avatar: Accursed (POGS)
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region.

- Added new Taunt: Fortune Cookie Taunt
* A wise man once said "he who learns must suffer", and sometimes you want your enemies to learn as much as they can from you. Give them their just desserts with the Fortune Cookie Taunt, whose profundity will offer something to think about while they wait to respawn.


== General ==

- Readjusted gold values for creeps getting the last hits on towers to be in line with players getting the hit 
* Consolation gold bounty readjusted from 315,350,385,420 to 265,325,440,500

Electrician

- Unholy Shackles now shows both range & radius when using simple tooltips

Magmus

Parasite
- Parasite's visual model should display correctly after coming out of an Infested creep

Rally
- Tyrant Rally's Compel now plays the proper effects and sounds

Rampage
- Stampede no longer stuns & pushes through Void Talisman

Salomon
- Fixed an extremely rare bug where Salomon can use Wish for Revenge to restart an existing Wish for Revenge immediately after he dies in this form

Sand Wraith
- Desert's Curse now correctly slows enemies for 1 second after leaving the sand trail if the spell was targeted directly on an enemy unit

The Gladiator

Voodoo Jester
- Fixed Mojo so that it applies the Spell Sunder damage state properly
- Acid Cocktail will no longer trigger the cooldown on Null Stone if Null Stone becomes ready after the Acid Cocktail projectile was already in midair

* The Blind Prophet and his Five Disciples know Newerth must be rid of the Seven Deadly Sins, and the only way to counter them is with the Seven Heavenly Virtues. Everyone touched by the war between the Legion and Hellbourne has a stain upon his or her soul, but there are some whose salvation is required to defeat the nefarious Sins. The first is Midas, who has tried for years to atone for his sin of Greed. He has finally achieved redemption, reborn as Charity, the purified version of Midas. He spreads his endless gold with every step and leads the fight against Greed and the Sins.

- Added new Succubus Alt Avatar: Chastity
* As the reformed version of Succubus, Chastity has given up her seductive and enchanting lifestyle for one more righteous and admirable. Although still naturally attractive, she uses this to her advantage, converting the heathens of Newerth to believe her pious words. Her goal is to show that the power of Sol can change your attitude without changing your natural personality. Sex sells, even for good.

- Added new Madman Alt Avatar: Chupacabra
* What's small, green, and goes bump in the night? More importantly, didn't you used to have a cat? The tiny terror known as the Chupacabra has found his way into the villages of Newerth, hiding in foxholes by day and drinking the blood of mammals by night. His claws are like razors and his teeth as sharp as tacks; at least, that's what the old wives tales say...

- Added new Gemini Alt Avatar: Cerberus
* The Hellbourne necromancers continue to harvest cursed souls from all realms of the underworld, and those tasked with guarding and protecting those souls have had enough. Cerberus, the three-headed hellhound who guards the gates of Hades, has been unleashed upon Newerth to gather and herd his missing souls back to the underworld. If he returns with more than he lost, so be it.

- Added new Myrmidon Alt Avatar: Sea King Myrmidon
* A fierce beast who controls the waters of Newerth, the Merlion is a respected symbol of power who once battled the forces of nature itself. It is a rare sight, and was thought to exist only in fairy tales and fictional accounts until it was spotted on the eastern Sang-La shore years ago by a wandering Legion soldier. The increase in daemons has brought the Merlion to the surface world, ready to slay the threat that seeks to plague his waters.

- Added new Geomancer Alt Avatar: Basilisk
* The Basilisk, eternal enemy of the World Tree, was defeated ages ago by Draconis and exiled into hibernation within an unbreakable egg made from the World Tree's bark. The Elder Evil gods have located the egg and used their fel magic to crack the prison, and the Basilisk's powerful venom did the rest. Now he is free once again to seek the roots of the World Tree, poison and devour them, and bring about the end of the Legion's hope.

- Added new Armadon Skin: Armadon (POGS)
* The POGS avatars are here! These high definition skins will be released one-per-patch and will be available via the store, Plinko, or both, depending upon the region

== Hero Balance ==

- The following Heroes are now allowed in Tournament Rules games
* Artillery
* Circe
* Salomon

Amun-Ra
+ We're comfortable with the previous directional focus towards toning down Ra's burst, however we still felt that he was still too strong. Ra is getting a partial revert to his previous armor increase. Amun Ra will now need to be more considerate of health regeneration both in lane and jungle.
- Starting Armor decreased from 2.0 to 1.5

Artillery
+ With the implementation of Artillery's rework, he has become capable of high damage potentials at incredible distances. We want to maintain his peaks but feel that he is reaching them way too early. We're slowing down his farming capabilities by reducing his creep clearing speed at the earlier stages of the game. Rockets from his LRM will no longer deal full aoe damage in the radius, this is most noticeable when farming the jungle.
- LRM: Each rocket now deals less damage the farther away you are from the center of the rocket impact

Blood Hunter
+ Feast has received an active allowing him to om nom an enemy unit. We all know Blood Hunter has always been excellent at 1 versus 1 match ups. It was however the only option he had open to him and as soon as another hero showed up to his lane he would get completely shut out. This change will open up a Blood Hunter's options in laning and give him ways of dealing with 1 v 2 situations as well as the opportunity to be a better jungler while also giving Feast a combat effective use.
- Feast: Can now activate this ability to instantly kill a creep or neutral in addition to its usual passive effects
* This ability may only target smaller Neutrals until it is leveled to 4, which is when it can target any Neutral

Chronos
+ Chronos with his mastery over time will now have an automatic timer countdown to reduce the charges of his Curse of Ages while not attacking. This will increase Chronos's ganking capabilities with a guaranteed bash on his first hit as opposed to the previous awkward feeling of stopping your attacks on creeps.
- Curse of Ages: Will automatically remove one charge every 5 seconds. Attacking resets the count down, such that no charges will be automatically removed when auto-attacking.

Defiler
+ Defiler's attack damage has been increased allowing her to more effectively harass enemies and exchange hits.
- Attack Damage increased from 41-49 to 45-51

Electrician
+ We want to reinforce the considerations of Electrician as a counter to buffs and debuffs. We've increased the uptime and lowered the mana cost of Cleansing Shock allowing for more consistent use both offensively and defensively.
- Electric Shield: Mana Cost to activate decreased from 10 to 5
- Cleansing Shock: Mana Cost decreased from 50 to 25
- Cleansing Shock: Cooldown decreased from 20/15/10 seconds to 16/12/8 seconds
- Cleansing Shock: Now instantly kills Illusions and summoned units

Ellonia
+ The base damage of Flash Freeze was too high causing Ellonia to freely spam the skill just as a stun with some damage. We're emphasizing the decision by increasing the reward and damage potential of the skill. Ellonia will now need to be more considerate of the choice when using her skill for the quick stun portion or saving it for the big burst of damage. We've also added a damage popup for her to see the results of their Frosted stacks.
- Flash Freeze: Base damage decreased from 40/80/120/160 to 40/60/80/100
- Flash Freeze: Damage per charge increased from 2/4/6/8 to 4/6/8/10
- Flash Freeze: Now shows a popup with the amount of total Damage dealt

Emerald Warden
+ We've found Emerald Warden's baseline of output too high for his late game potential while not offering enough utility in the early stages. Emerald Warden has suffered a minor hit to his stat gain and Overgrowth has been refocused to be a much better asset early game allowing for more defensive use.
- Agility gain per level decreased from 3 to 2.8
- Overgrowth: Duration decreased from 1/2/3/4 seconds to 1.5/2.0/2.5/3.0 seconds

Engineer
+ Relevant at all stages of the game, the Engineer has plenty of strengths but was lacking in weaknesses. We wanted to keep the late game potential that Engineer can achieve so we've hit the early game power levels instead. Keg has had it's mana cost increased and damage reduced at the early levels lowering his spammability. Steam Turret has had it's slow duration reduced allowing enemies to recover their speed much sooner when exiting the turret's range. Teams will need to be more considerate of their early game support options as Engineer will have a more difficult time competing with the hero pool.
- The Keg: Mana Cost increased from 80/100/120/140 to 95/110/125/140
- The Keg: Damage rescaled from 100/150/200/250 to 80/140/200/260
- Steam Turret: Slow Duration decreased from 5 seconds to 3 seconds
- Energy Field: Cooldown increased from 85 to 105/95/85

Gravekeeper
+ Grave Keeper has had a hard time complimenting a team lineup. We've increased his utility allowing him gank and even support more effectively. Corpse Toss has had it's range increased reducing the risk involved for Grave Keeper to engage enemies. Defiling Touch slow duration has been doubled, allowing the Grave Keeper to more efficiently chase enemies with a continual pelt of the same corpse. Plus, ZOMBIES!
- Corpse Toss: Increased the range from 500 to 550
- Corpse Toss: Charge refresh interval decreased from 9 seconds to 7 seconds
- Defiling Touch: Slow duration increased from 1 second to 2 seconds
- Defiling Touch: Movement Speed Slow increased from 20/25/30/35% to 25/30/35/40%

Hellbringer
+ Reinforcing Hellbringer's team fight impact, we've given his only single target skill more utility in team fights. Unholy Shackles will now affect multiple enemies in the area.
- Unholy Shackles: Now slows all units around your target as well as your target
* 300 AOE around the target

Keeper of the Forest
- Starting Armor decreased from 3.1 to 1.1
+ Keeper of the Forest is getting the axe, largely to his base armor and Nature's Veil. We want lane options to be both enjoyable and interactive. We feel that Keeper's passive play and sustainability in lane has minimized any risk involved for both parties. Keeper of the Forest will need to be more considerate of his frequent use of Nature's Veil and exchange of hits with enemies.
- Nature's Veil: Health Regen decreased from 4 to 3
- Nature's Veil: Mana Cost increased from 60 to 70
- Animate Trees: Health decreased from 600 to 550
- Animate Trees: Minions Movement Speed decreased from 325 to 300

Kinesis
+ We're proud to release the new and upgraded Kinesis. We've made the hero feel much more fluid, rewarding players for the high input they can only find in the play style that Kinesis provides. First, the removal of the cast time from the actions of lifting and throwing. Both will now be usable while moving and attacking, providing a much better flow when executing multiple actions. Second, Inherent Defense will now grant Kinesis additional Movement Speed based on his shield value allowing Kinesis to constantly chase and bombard enemies, reinforcing his concept as a mid range caster. Lastly, The first activation of Mass Control will now drag all things Kinesis has lifted towards him, allowing him to setup his power prior to entering dangerous river areas or the occasional use of portal key.
- Telekinetic Control: Charge refresh interval decreased from 4/3.5/3/2.5 to 4.0/3.3/2.6/2.0 seconds
- Telekinetic Control: Increased the radius in which he can pick up trees from 600 to 800
- Telekinetic Control: Cast action time on throw decreased from 200 to 0
- Telekinetic Control: Can now lift and throw while moving and Attacking
- Inherent Defense: Now grants +0.25 Movement Speed per point of shield value. Always a base of 10 Movement Speed
- Inherent Defense: Shield per Damage generation re-scaled from 12.5/25/37.5/50% to 20/30/40/50% of damage attempted
- Mass Control: For the duration of the first activation, all lifted objects will follow Kinesis at 522 speed

Klanx
+ The damage stipulation on the activation of H.A.W.K. has been removed. We felt that the downsides of this ability were unnecessary leaving a very negative feeling for the Klanx. We've also increased the move speed of his Goon Squad minions to compliment his high mobility play style.
- H.A.W.K.: Removed the cooldown triggered from Damage
- Goon Squad: Increase the Movement Speed of the minions by 100

Martyr
+ Martyr players rejoice, the uptime and damage reduction of Guardian Angel has been increased. Martyr can now share a significant portion of the pain even as an under leveled support.
- Guardian Angel: Cooldown decreased from 21/18/15/12 seconds to 8 seconds
- Guardian Angel: Damage reduction increased from 20/30/40/50 to 35/40/45/50

Master of Arms
+ Slight reduction to Master of Arm's reach and power at the earlier levels. Enemies will have an easier time escaping the Master's charged shot after being hit by a long range Forked Lightning.
- Charged Shot: Cast range decreased from 550 to 500
- Forked Lightning: Slow decreased from 80% to 50/60/70/80%

Midas
+ Midas is a fantastic hero that is a lot of fun to play, he brings just the right amount of skill and entertainment. He does however lack in how effective he can be until he reaches level six. We believe that his reliance on what his ultimate is doing was keeping this hero down so we decided to let him level his ultimate starting at level four instead.
- Transmute: May now be leveled up at levels 4/8/12 instead of 6/11/16

Monarch
+ For a long time players have been drawing comparisons to Monarch and Glacius. It was always the intent to have Glacius as the more offensive choice while Monarch to be more of the lane support. We decided to make those differences stand out a bit more by increasing those support roles within monarch, while at the same time giver her an over all buff that she was needing.
- Crippling Pollen: Range increased from 500 to 600
- Crippling Pollen: Projectile speed decreased from 1200 to 800
- Chrysalis: Duration decreased from 4 seconds to 3 seconds
- Chrysalis: Heal rescaled from 35/50/65/80 to 30/50/70/90
- Chrysalis: Damage Reduction rescaled from 30/40/50/60% to 50% at all levels
- Noxious Cloud: Radius now starts at 250 instead of 150 and ends at 550 instead of 500 over the 4 second life time
- Cleansing Winds: Width increased from 175/200/225 to 200/225/250

Night Hound
+ With the previous power reduction to Night Hound, we're comfortable with his concept of fight or flight. Backstab has received a damage increase to better reward the Night Hound for his stealthy play.
- Backstab: Bonus Damage Multiplier increased from 25/50/75/100% to 30/60/90/120%

Oogie
+ The mana monster returns, Oogie was treading on the problems of needing an unreasonable amount of mana to enjoy his early game. We've lowered the mana increase on Tar Quake and reduced the cooldown of Kindled Fury creating a much better flow between the constant spending of mana and Fury attacks.
- Tar Quake: Mana Cost intervals after every cast decreased from 40 to 30
- Kindled Fury: Cooldown decreased from 11/10/9/8 to 8
- Kindled Fury: Mana cooldown reduction changed from 100 mana to 75
- Primal Surge: Cooldown decreased from 80/60/40 to 60/50/40

Pharaoh
+ Often a great compliment to a team, the Pharoah has always been constantly mana starved. Pharaoh has received some additional Intelligence to reduce his farming requirements and encourage more active ganking.
- Starting Intelligence increased by 2
- Intelligence gain increased from 1.3 to 1.5

Pestilence
+ We're comfortable with Pestilence's roles as initiation and armor reducer, however the constant spam of bashing combined with inherent tankiness leaves for little counter-play response. Pestilence's stat gain and damage output has been lowered reducing his overall survivability and carry potential.
- Strength gain decreased from 2.8 to 2.5
- Agility gain decreased from 1.9 to 1.5
- Gore: Damage decreased from 20/40/60/80 to 10/20/30/40

Pollywog Priest
+ Electric Jolt's radius has been increased allowing Pollywog to more effectively harass enemies in combination with clearing creeps.
- Electric Jolt: Radius increased from 400 to 500

Ravenor
+ Ravenor has received a slew of buffs over the previous patches that have put him over the top. We are happy with the damage potential Ravenor provides as a Magic Damage carry but are unhappy with inconsiderate frequent use of his abilities. Ravenor's mana efficiency has been significantly decreased. Ball Lightning's cost has been increased at the lower levels, in combination with a flat increase to Storm Blades. Ravenor will need to be more considerate of his item choices, especially when obtaining an early Portal Key.
- Intelligence gain decreased from 2.2 to 2.0
- Base Damage decreased from 49-59 to 48-56
- Ball Lightning: Mana Cost increased from 90/100/110/120 to 110 at all levels
- Storm Blades: Mana Cost increased from 80/90/100/110 to 90/100/110/120

Sand Wraith
+ Sand Wraith has received an overall power reduction, most notably his Magic Armor decrease. Sand Wraith was surprisingly difficult to kill with his high stats and damage reduction from Dissipate. The Sand Wraith will now have to be more considerate of both his skill and item builds, balancing his offense and defense.
- Agility gain decreased from 2.2 to 2.0
- Magic Armor decreased from 5.5 to 4.0
- Desert's Curse: Movement Speed bonus decreased from 6/10/14/18% to 6/8/10/12%
- Mirage: Summoned illusion duration increased from 4/4.5/5 to 4/5/6
- Mirage: Cooldown increased from 120/100/80 seconds to 130/105/80 seconds

Scout
+ Scout has an iconic play style for his constant roaming and ganking but can be frustrating for the enemy team. We wanted to maintain the fun play style for Scout so we've instead looked at increasing the amount of counter-play for the enemy team. We've doubled the fade time of Vanish and reduced the overall move speed bonus allowing enemies to more effectively chase the Scout with various true sight items. Vanish has had it's mana cost increased affecting his creep clearing speed and reducing his overall snowball ability.
- Intelligence gain per level increased from 1.4 to 1.6
- Vanish: Activation Mana Cost increased from 30 to 50
- Vanish: Fade time increased from 0.5 to 1.0 second
- Vanish: Movement Speed bonus decreased from 10/15/20/25% to 6/9/12/15%
- Electric Eye: Gadget Health decreased from 200 to 1

Sir Benzington
+ Sir Benzington has high mobility combined with a high damage potential, however that potential is extremely difficult to achieve. We've increased the range and speed of Joust allowing for long range engagements but keeping the side step counter-play for enemies equally as meaningful. Lance-A-Long has been rescaled in damage to deal it's full potential over 4 attacks instead of 5 and rescaled accordingly making each individual attack buildup.
- Joust: Mana Cost decreased from 110 to 90/100/110/120
- Joust: Charge Speed increased from 2400 to 2800
- Joust: Range increased from 900 to 1000
- Joust: Stun duration increased from 0.7 seconds to 1.0 seconds
- Lance-A-Long: Charges needed decreased from 5 attacks to 4 attacks
- Lance-A-Long: Mana Cost decreased from 70/80/90/100 to 75/80/85/90
- Lance-A-Long: Damage per charge changed from 10/18/26/34 to 15/25/35/40
- Lance-A-Long: Base activation Damage decreased from 50/90/130/170 to 40/80/120/160

Succubus
+ Iconic for her disables at all stages of the game, we've increased the frequency that Succubus may cast her ultimate at the later levels creating more opportunities for both the Succubus to gank and for the enemy to interrupt.
- Succubus's Hold: Cooldown decreased from 120/110/100 to 120/100/80

Tempest
+ Tempest's team fight potential is unmatched but is not without counter-play. We wanted to preserve the great feelings that a "good ol temp ult" hits so were looking at lowering his early game snowball potential instead. Glacial Blasts has had it's cast range lowered, reducing his approachability from early game ganking, most noticeably without boots. Elementals will also deal reduced damage, lowering his jungling speed and pushing potential. Tempest will need to be more considerate of his item choices when he isn't being showered with gold.
- Glacial Blasts: Cooldown increased from 15 seconds to 18 seconds
- Glacial Blasts: Range decreased from 600 to 500
- Glacial Blasts: Debuff is now dispellable to prevent additional stuns
- Elemental: Attack Damage decreased from 20/27/34/41 to 18/24/30/36
- Elemental Void: Outer ring Damage per second decreased from 30/50/70 to 15/25/35
* Damage of the inner ring is unchanged

The Gladiator
+ Showdown in itself is a lackluster skill for the large strain on Gladiator's limited mana pool. The mana cost and cooldown of Showdown have been reduced allowing for more frequent use in combination with those great feeling Pitfalls or Call to Arms.
- Showdown: Mana Cost decreased from 80/90/100/110 to 65/75/85/95
- Showdown: Cooldown decreased from 30 seconds to 20 seconds
- Call to Arms: Cooldown decreased from 100 seconds to 100/90/80 seconds

Thunderbringer
+ So we all know that since the dawn of time Thunderbringer has been capable of revealing invisible targets when he casts his Blast of Lightning. We feel that this mechanic while good on paper was not good in practice. It was rarely something you even considered. We wanted to increase it's functionality by allowing thunderbringer to cast it on himself, making him essentially a moving counter-ward.
- Movement Speed increased from 295 to 300
- Starting Armor increased from 1.54 to 2.0
- Blast of Lightning: Now can cast on yourself or any ally to grant them +75 bonus Movement Speed for 5 seconds
* The Truesight and Clearvision that Blast of Lightning creates around an enemy will be around the targeted Ally as well

Tremble
+ Tremble is notable for his map presence and pushing potential. We've lowered the mana costs of Terrorform and Hive Mind, allowing for more frequent use to promote his active mobile play style. Boris's strength and utility have also been increased, most noticeably the early level ganking capabilities.
- Terrorform: Mana Cost decreased from 150/140/130/120 to 120
- Hive Mind: Mana Cost decreased from 140 to 100/125/150
- Boris: Armor Reduction increased from -1/-2/-3 to -2/-3/-4
- Boris: Ensnare duration increased from 1/1.5/2 seconds to 1.5/1.75/2 seconds

Tundra
+ We feel that Tundra has fallen off over time. Were emphasizing the utility that Tundra provides to his teammates. Shiver the bird will have it's vision increased at the earlier levels making it a much stronger one point skill. Cold Shoulder has had it's cooldown decreased, at the later levels Tundra will provide a 100% uptime on his Attack Speed boost to his allies.
- Cold Shoulder: Cooldown decreased from 24/20/16/12 to 17/14/11/8
- Call of Winter: Shiver day vision changed from 700/700/1200/1200 to 800/800/1200/1200
- Call of Winter: Shiver night vision changed from 500/500/1000/1000 to 600/600/1000/1000

Voodoo Jester
+ Extremely fragile as a support, we've increased the cast range of Cursed Ground and Spirit Ward reducing the risk involved for a squishy Voodoo Jester to engage enemies.
- Cursed Ground: Range increased from 400 to 450
- Cursed Ground: Cast Time decreased from 1000 to 750
* This does not change how long it takes for the ability to land, this is the animation time after
- Spirit Ward: Range increased from 300/350/400 to 400

War Beast
+ The uptime of Warcry has been reduced to lower the impact of his global assistance to other lanes. We've also increased his jungling speed allowing Warbeast himself to contribute in fights much sooner in the game.
- Summon Hellhounds: Damage increased from 20/29/38/47 to 24/32/40/48
- Battle Cry: Cooldown increased from 25 seconds to 35 seconds

Wretched Hag
+ Combination of good utility, high mobility and damage, the Wretched Hag has a good kit that keeps her relevant at all stages of the game. We've lowered the duration of the slow portion on Haunt allowing enemies to better deal with her high mobility, especially after a wide Bat Blast.
- Haunt: Slow duration decreased from 10 seconds to 7 seconds
- Sonar Scream: Mana Cost increased from 140 to 135/140/145/150
- Bat Blast: Damage decreased from 290/430/600 to 290/420/550


== Item Balance ==

Added new Item: Ioyn Stone
- Costs 300g
- +60 Max Health
- +45 Max mana
- When in your inventory, right-click a Rune (or use this item targeting a Rune) to power the Stone with 3 charges based on the Rune. Does not consume the Rune
- The charges last up to 4 minutes
- When powered, target yourself or an ally to consume a charge and give them a short duration buff based on the Rune that is stored in the Stone
- Does not stack with other Ioyn Stones or Bottles

Added new Item: Spell Sunder
- Components: Pickled Brain (950), Major Totem (490), Manatube (875) = 2315g Total
- Dealing any Magic Damage applies a debuff to the target for 3 seconds. They take 5 damage + 3% of the Target's current health in Magic Damage every second
- Dealing Magic DoT Damage applies this debuff as well, but the damage it deals is halved

Lightbrand and Components
+ The damage over time portion of Lightbrand and it's upgrades have been reworked. Attacks will now deal a lower amount but True Damage every second instead of Magic. Were comfortable with the flat mana regeneration granted appealing largely to lower Int heroes but are unhappy with the excessive farming that the item is granting from auto attacks. Light Brand and it's upgrades will deal less damage to creeps but relatively the same damage to heroes.

Lightbrand
- DoT Damage decreased from 8 to 5 per second
- DoT Damage changed from Magic Damage to True Damage

Searing Light
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 5 to 4
- DoT Damage decreased from 12 to 7.5 per second
- DoT Damage changed from Magic Damage to True Damage

Frozen Light
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 5 to 4
- DoT Damage decreased from 12 to 7.5 per second
- DoT Damage changed from Magic Damage to True Damage

Dawnbringer
- Damage decreased from 15 to 12
- Mana Regeneration decreased from 6 to 5
- DoT Damage decreased from 16 to 10 per second
- DoT Damage changed from Magic Damage to True Damage

Grimoire of Power
- DoT Damage decreased from 35 to 20 per second
- DoT Damage changed from Magic Damage to True Damage

Insanitarius
+ Insanitarious is an item that creates anticipation and rewards great timing. We wanted to increase the frequency at which players can squeeze out the last bit of health for a big mannup.
- Cooldown decreased from 7 seconds to 5 seconds

Lex Talionis
+ The concept of Lex Talionis was originally designed to appeal to support heroes. We've lowered the mana cost activation and increased the cast range to allow safer and more frequent use of this early game offensive support option.
- Mana Cost decreased from 50 to 25
- Range increased from 750 to 800

Nullfire Blade
+ Nullfire Blade is a niche pick often used to burn enemy mana or dispel enemy buffs or hostile debuffs. We want to emphasize the decision more by increasing the utility of the item. The cooldown has been decreased, and the cast range has been increased to allow more free use of the activation.
- Cooldown decreased from 20 to 14
- Range increased from 600 to 700
- Cost decreased from 800 to 700

Spellshards
+ We're refocusing Spellshards to a more niche counter-pick to move it away from this troublesome comparison to Grimoire of Power. The Spell Penetration will now be a counter to higher magic armor values, dealing a percentage of their defense as opposed to a flat value.
- Reworked: Spell penetration changed from 2/4/6 to 50% of target's Magic Armor
- No longer has upgrades
- Recipe Cost increased from 800 to 1200

Staff of the Master
- Rally - Seismic Slam range increased from 250 to 500 and Damage increased by 200
- Pyromancer - Upon killing an enemy with Blazing Strike, deals 50% of the damage in a 600 radius around the target
- Succubus - In addition to its previous bonuses, Range increased to 900

Wingbow
+ Wingbow, as an expensive end game item, was lacking in satisfaction for the owner. We want players to appreciate the effectiveness of their hard earned purchases so we've added some spice to the item.

- Added new Bubbles Ultimate Alt Avatar: Cosmonaut Bubbles
* For those condemned to a life too close to the ground, the wonders of outer space blanket their dreams with twinkles of hope, surrounded by the bleakness of doubt and despair. While other Legion heroes fantasize about becoming legends and kings on Newerth, Bubbles stares at the moon, wondering what it would be like to see something besides war and chaos. With a little time and some repurposing of scrap material from the Iron City, one turtle seeks out something bigger than himself, dressed in a suit so strange that even his best friends think he's crazy

- Added new Solstice Ultimate Alt Avatar: Winter Solstice
* In her day form, Winter Solstice protects herself from the power of the sun with a set of armor covered in a thick layer of ice. Her movement is a bit slower, and her actions more reserved, but her power is concentrated, like a mighty iceberg. In her night form, Winter Solstice explodes with the power of Lunari, unable to contain the might of the Moon Goddess. Her skin is set ablaze, lighting up the night around her and exposing any threats where they creep in the darkness. She becomes quicker and more agile without her armor, but also more vengeful, and often incapable of slowing down or showing remorse

- Added new Gauntlet Alt Avatar: Grendel
* In the Scandinavian wilderness, only the toughest creatures can survive. Among them, grizzled and weathered from the harsh winter storms, Grendel Gauntlet ambles the forests alone, searching for what he can find to eat and storing the rest in his little mud hut. On his back, the helmets of warriors who have sought to slay him act both as trophies and as warnings to other "heroes" looking to make a name for themselves

- Added new Aluna Alt Avatar: Santa Baby Aluna
* Ringing in the holidays by wearing her sexiest Santa outfit, Aluna is in the mood to gift pain and devastation to the grumpy Hellbourne daemons. Despite her cute candy cane and sultry demeanor, monsters would be better off running away when they hear her bells jingling through the forest. 

- Added new Demented Shaman Alt Avatar: Lollipop Shaman
* Only suckas wouldn't want to smash the fun out of the holidays with this sweet-and clearly demented-young lady from Bloodsugar Valley. She's here with her hard candy hammer to ring in the New Year and give a lickin' to anyone who isn't festive enough for her tastes. Watch your bells!

- Added new Bombardier Alt Avatar: Ice Cream Bombardier
* Ice cream headaches for everyone! Glucoz the Ice Cream Bombardier has pedaled his ice cream bicycle all the way from Bloodsugar Valley to sell his special recipe in Newerth (hint: it has a hint of kerosene, with heavy notes of gunpowder). It doesn't matter if you get Charred Chocolate, Volatile Vanilla, or Semtex Strawberry-they all burst with flavor! Seriously, your head will explode

- Added new Plague Rider Alt Avatar: Candy Rider
* Not everything is gumdrops and lollipops in Bloodsugar Valley, especially if you're an ill-tempered lich with a Napoleon Complex. Equipped with a popsicle staff and an unflinching grimace, the Candy Rider and his frosted dragon will do whatever it takes to establish themselves as legitimate threats, despite their childish appearances. His words may be sugar coated, but his actions are deceitful, and if you see the ice cream on his helmet melting, you know things are getting heated

- Added new Balphagore Alt Avatar: Baker Balphagore
* We hear Baker Balphagore's cookies are delicious, but he keeps eating them before we can get a taste. Maybe it's for the best, as the rumors out of Bloodsugar Valley say he uses his giant spatula and whisk to mix his victims into a sticky batter before popping them in the oven to emerge as gingerbread minions, armed with razor-sharp sporks and heavy frying pans

- Added new Pandamonium Alt Avatar: Amanda Panda
* Amanda Panda arrived at HoNCon wearing her perfect Pandamonium costume and ready to win the Hero Look-Alike Contest. But when she surveyed the competition, everyone was dressed in such realistic hero costumes she couldn't tell the difference between them and the real members of the Legion and Hellbourne. When the very impressive Maliken cosplayer transformed into a giant, hulking demon and seemed to actually be possessed, Amanda Panda began to suspect there was no such thing as HoNCon... 

- Added new Bramble Alt Avatar: Bobbi Bramble
* You think you're tough? Say it to Bobbi's face, if you can stand her putrid Spore Breath. This tomboy can't stand wimps (vegetarians included), and the way you're staring at her homemade Bramble costume is making you look like a major jabroni. I'd turn around and walk away right now if I were you. Don't let the Vine Wall hit you on the way out, loser

- Added new Slither Alt Avatar: Sally Slither
* Growing up as a nerdy girl fascinated with reptiles, Sally quickly took to Slither as her favorite hero. Having been teased throughout her childhood for preferring the scaly to the furry, she created a full Slither outfit for herself, complete with an acid-spraying snake hat to intimidate those who would bully her. After all, it's hard to point and laugh when your hands are melting off

- Added new Name Color: Frost Fields Silver
* This dazzling silver name color hails from the frozen north, and only the most dedicated players can obtain it!

- Added 12 days of Christmas Chat symbols
* If you collect all 12 exclusive chat symbols, you will receive the Grendel Gauntlet Product for free!

== New Content ==

- Added new Berserker Alt Avatar: Orbode
* Unable to cope with the loss of his mentor, the most brutal of the Disciples, Orbode, was nearly driven insane. He roamed the outskirts of Newerth, the fringes of human land where the beasts ventured into human territory, holding back their onslaught with the violent anger of Sol. Orbode's followers formed the Second Clan of Men, the Savages, whose brute strength and unbridled fury tore through the ranks of the Beast Horde with no remorse.
* Releases 12/04/13

- Added new Silhouette Alt Avatar: Arbinger
* The loss of the Prophet begot a profound sadness to the Disciple Arbinger, who guarded her emotions behind a mask emblazoned with the symbol of the Five. She silently condemned her brethren for not protecting their savior, and ventured into the heart of the beasts' realm, stalking and slaughtering them before they could commit any more sins of such magnitude. Arbinger's followers formed the Fourth Clan of Men, the Scouts, silently targeting the beasts where they slept under the shadow of darkness.
* Releases 12/04/13

- Added new Kinesis Alt Avatar: Augur
* When the Blind Prophet was murdered, his Disciple Augur traveled into the northern mountains and worked tirelessly to rebuild Man's lost cities, as well as her shattered faith in her brothers and sisters-the shards of which still blind her-for she did not know it was the goddess Circe who had killed the Blind Prophet. Augur's followers formed the Third Clan of Men, the Builders, their artisan hands guided by Augur's divine vision.
* Releases 12/06/13

- Added new Prophet Ultimate Alt Avatar: The Blind Prophet
* When Circe assassinated the Blind Prophet over 250 years ago, his martyrdom sent the Five Disciples to the corners of Newerth, spreading Sol's word. With the rise of Maliken Grimm, King of the Legion, Sol's children rose to soaring heights. When Maliken betrayed his god and kin, so began the downward spiral of all that is good. Now, with archaic gods wrestling for power and man-made death machines rolling through Jeraziah's ranks, Sol has resurrected the Blind Prophet and his Five Disciples. Our King's prayers have been answered...but will it be enough?
* Releases 12/11/13

- Added new Nomad Alt Avatar: Eskinomad
* After traveling the vast desert landscape and finding no trace of the Sand Wraith that slaughtered his family, Nomad takes it upon himself to trek across all of Newerth, searching for and destroying wraiths in whatever form they appear. Living in the cold, barren Frost Fields, he dons warmer gear and wanders from one end of the wasteland to another, weathering the freezing cold for a chance to exact revenge against the spirits.
* Releases 12/13/13

* Bots now have preferences for which lane they are in, and the teambotbrain does a much better job of building smarter lanes.

-------------
== General ==

- Added new Hero: Klanx
* All rejoice! Klanx is here, the most diabolical villain to ever grace the world of Newerth! No other minds can comprehend his genius, and even heroic eyes can barely gaze upon his rugged visage without collapsing in admiration. Forget Tork the Engineer and his inferior intellect and supposed ingenuity-Klanx is about to swagger onto the battlefield equipped with his latest and greatest weaponry, as well as a full supply of faithful lackeys and goons. Victories are his for the taking, and they should feel lucky to belong to such a stunning force of brilliant destruction. 
* Releases 11/20/2013

- Added new Klanx Ultimate Edition Alt Avatar: Doomsday Klanx
* Klanx's ultimate design, the Doomsday Klanx robot, is finally ready for combat after dozens of tests against defenseless civilians. The only flaw Klanx can see is the Doomsday Klanx isn't is handsome as he is...but that would be impossible.

Equipped with only the best and baddest mechanical contraptions-which he built, of course-this dashing and debonair bandit of the open air is full of enough dirty deeds to make even the most despicable demons cringe in disgust. Twirl â€˜stache, get cash.
* Releases 11/20/2013

== New Content ==

- Added new Engineer Ultimate Alt Avatar: Tork the Ultimate Engineer
* Tork the Engineer knows Man is flawed, especially those who put too much faith into their gods and not enough work into their weapons. He is also aware his purely mechanical creations like Steamoth excel at warfare, but lack the human aspects that make a true hero. In his tireless work to create the perfect warrior, he has combined his engineering genius with his compassion and will to win. The result is the Ultimate Engineer, a biomechanical suit that upgrades as necessary to handle any combat situation.
* Releases 11/20/2013

- Added new Jeraziah Alt Avatar: Omen
* Contemplating the existence of the being to which he has devoted his life, Jeraziah decides that he may not understand everything, but his faith requires doubt, and his belief in Sol is solidified. He is rewarded by the Blind Prophet for never turning his back on the righteous god, and is granted a suit of armor that was worn by the original Blind Disciple knight, Omen: a man of commanding stature who vowed to build from his followers an army that would reclaim Newerth for Man and spread the worship of Sol to all corners of the world.
* Releases 11/22/2013

- Added new Corrupted Disciple Alt Avatar: Edium
* After Circe murdered the Blind Prophet, his Five Disciples scattered across Newerth to spread the word of Sol. Edium, the First Disciple, eschewed worldly ways and turned in reverence to studying the sacred text, the Codex Solaris, and went on to establish the Order of the Chapel. When he died, Sol lost a powerful apostle.
In these dire times, with archaic gods and rampant daemonic forces tearing Man's faith apart, the Five Disciples have returned with the Blind Prophet to shepherd Sol's flock to victory. His years in the divine realm have made him a dynamic warrior, with eyes covered by the guiding hands of Sol and hands coursing with the energy of pure devotion to his faith.
* Releases 11/27/2013

- Added new Magmus Alt Avatar: Cryo Magmus
* In the days of the Blind Prophet, the followers of Sol outlawed alchemy as an affront to their faith. The persecution even reached into the far north of the Frost Fields, where a hermitous alchemist was dragged from his workshop and thrown into an icy crevasse. As his frozen tomb closed in, he whispered incantations and doused himself with potions to summon an ice elemental. The ancient creature formed around the alchemist and began the creeping ascent back to the surface. The duo has finally emerged-heartless elemental and furious alchemist-and their sole purpose is to bring vengeance upon all followers of Sol and the Blind Prophet.

- Cryo Magmus will be a Limited Edition Event Avatar given away at DreamHack Winter 2013

- Added new Courier: Turkey Courier
* Who you callin' turkey? Show your online friends that Thanksgiving is not for the birds by picking up the new Turkey Courier, and maybe they'll send some mashed potatoes & gravy to your lane.
* Achievable through a match rewards event

What the Hellbourne genius will do with all those collected souls, no one knows...
* Releases 11/6/2013

- Added new Master of Arms Alt Avatar: Master of Cybernetics
* Giving up his body for the sake of the Legion, Master of Arms has fitted himself with the most advanced cybernetic bodysuit the Blacksmiths were able to construct. 50% human, 50% robot, and 100% ready to melt the Hellbourne ranks with a barrage computer-aided of weaponry, the Master of Cybernetics is a deadly foe with all the skills of a mercenary soldier and all the power of a nuclear reactor.
* Releases 11/6/2013

- Added new Moon Queen Alt Avatar: Eclipse
* A ruler of distant galaxies and a jaw-dropping beauty in all of them, Eclipse is a stunning example of alien breeding and near-utopian culture. Having been in contact with humans before the Fall of Man through technology like Gundromeda, she recognizes the existential threat that the Hellbourne daemons and spirits now pose to regions beyond Newerth and its galaxy, and joins the fight to rid them from the known universe.
* Releases 11/8/2013
 
- Added new Parasite Alt Avatar: NanoParasite
* The mysterious Hellbourne inventor has outdone himself this time; just ask him. His NanoParasite is built entirely using nanotechnology and is programmed with the sole purpose of infecting Legion heroes with a potent virus to spread its vile presence across Newerth.
* Releases 11/13/2013

- Added new Armadon Alt Avatar: Robodon
* Building upon the strength and durability of the slow-witted Armadon was not an easy task, but increasing his intelligence was a much more realistic goal. Stuffed to the brim with a phalanx of missiles and equipped with oil pumps for lubrication of his massive limbs, the Robodon is an industrial miracle, showcasing both the defensive and offensive capabilities of the Legion's robotic engineering prowess.
* Releases 11/13/2013
 
- Added new Rally Alt Avatar: Bogatyr
* No greater glory exists for the wandering Bogatyr than helping those who cannot help themselves. His treasure lies not in the physical riches that he could have for his heroic deeds-and in fact, he detests the thought of helping the well-off for political or capital gain-but in the virtue of selflessness through battle. He is a symbol of pride, respect, and leadership.
* Releases 11/15/2013


== New Map & Mode: Rift Wars Beta ==

* Releases 10/23/2013

- Added new Draconis Alt Avatar: Mecha Draconis
* An ambitious move by the Legion to combine the power of the ancient protector Draconis with forgotten technology that once wrought destruction upon an entire generation has resulted in a mechanical wyvern so sleek and deadly that obtaining a piece of his body is even more valuable than the treasure Draconis once protected.
* Releases 10/23/2013

- Added an upgrade to Taunt: Super Taunt
* Use the Super Taunt like kryptonite to utterly demolish your opponent. And his support. And his buddy who went mid. And the jungler. And then him again. Because when you're this good, "super" is the only way to describe your skill.

* Releases 10/23/2013

* Releases 10/25/2013

- Added new Amun-Ra Alt Avatar: RoboRa

- Added new Nomad Alt Avatar: Exterminator Nomad
* A relic of the genocides that occurred during the scientific enlightenment before the Fall of Man, the Exterminator Nomad was sent on roaming missions by the government to infiltrate underground resistance camps and exterminate them one by one.

- Added new Keeper of the Forest Alt Avatar: Willow Keeper
* The Willow Keeper is an impressive sight to behold: a wise and grizzled old treant rumored to be one of the first offspring from the World Tree. Having survived in some of the harshest environments throughout time, from the waterless Savannahs to the life-rotting Rulian Marsh, his durability will surely be a boon to the defenses of the Legion soldiers, beasts, and flora.
* Releases 10/11/2013

- Added new Andromeda Alt Avatar: Gundromeda
* After crash-landing in the northern forests of Caldavar, this celestial maiden was excavated from her crater and brought to the Iron City for the Engineers to study. While her armor may be dinged up, her CPU remains unharmed and ready to aid the Legion, both in battle and in understanding the technology of man before the Fall.
* Releases 10/16/2013

- Added new Lodestone Alt Avatar: Penitent Lodestone
* Before the Hellbringers had fully perfected the dark art of imbuing daemonic contraptions with the souls of the damned, Dr. Repulsor took matters into his own hands with a series of "experiments" that even some Hellbourne would consider vile. Dissecting captured Legion prisoners and inserting cables into their bodies fueled the robotic war machines known as Penitent Lodestones by way of pain and suffering, forcing the pilots to willingly subject themselves to war for a chance to end their constant misery.
* Releases 10/16/2013

- Added new Aluna Alt Avatar: Steampunk Aluna
* When it's time to put brass to ass, nobody is better suited for the job than Steampunk Aluna. Fitted with coiled stilettos and enough gears to shake a (pneumatic) stick at, this feisty heroine is ready to prove the Hellbourne threat is nothing but hot air. The battle for Newerth just got a little steamier, figuratively and literally.
* Releases 10/18/2013

- Stealth abilities can no longer be purged or transferred

Amun-Ra
+ Ra has always been a fan favorite for a lot of players. The lane presence of Ra combined with allies has become too lethal so we're toning down his burst damage. To compensate, we are allowing Ashes to Ashes to work on creep damage again, bringing back his ability to jungle efficiently. The increased radius and removal of attack speed helps refine Ra's focus towards Magic Damage over time.
- Increased Armor by 1
- Path of Destruction: Reduced damage from 110/180/250/320 to 90/140/190/240
- Ignite: Reduced damage from 80/120/160/200 to 60/100/140/180
- Ashes to Ashes: Now works on creeps again
- Ashes to Ashes: Radius increased from 350 to 400
- Ashes to Ashes: removed attack speed

Aluna
+ Power Throw is individually a strong ability. Rather than reducing its high damage, we've increased the mana cost instead to bring it more in line with other nukes.
- Power Throw: Increased mana from 100/110/120/130 to 110/120/130/140

Behemoth
+ Behemoth has always been an iconic wrecking bomb with a portal key. We feel it is time to bring back some of his old strengths by alleviating some of his mana cost issues and putting a larger emphasis on his reward for Shockwave.
- Increased starting Intelligence from 16 to 17
- Increased Intelligence gain per level from 1.8 to 2.0
- Fissure: Mana Cost lowered from 125,140,155,170 to 120,130,140,150
- Shockwave: Increases the radius from 500 to 600
- Shockwave: Increases the bonus radius per unit from 500 to 600
- Shockwave: Cooldown lowered from 150,130,110 to 130,120,110

Bombardier
+ Boom Dust has always felt awkward with the range being significantly less than attack range. While we don't want it to be free damage on every auto attack, we are increasing the range to feel much better in the laning phase.
- Boom Dust: Increased cast range from 500 to 550

Cthulhuphant
+ With the emphasis of movement speed from a lot of more recent items and heroes, we feel Cthuluphant has experienced a large increase in difficulty of landing trample.
- Trample: increased the speed from 700 to 800

Dampeer
+ Alongside our direction nerfs to reduce unskilled burst, we're comfortable with Dampeer's baseline output however we're reducing his maximum damage potential. These changes will be most noticeable with the maximum number of essences.
- Terrorize: Reduces bonus damage granted from each essence from 30 to 25
- Vampiric Flight: Reduces bonus damage granted from each essence from 20 to 15
- Vampiric Flight: Fixed a string error with the heal per essence from 15 to 5 (gameplay values remain the same)
- Consume: Reduces bonus damage granted from each essence from 40,60,80 to 35,55,75

Devourer
+ Devourer's overall damage output has been too high. Devourer's intention has always been to be a brute force tank with high magic damage output at the cost of his own safety. Rather than toning down the exciting thins about the hero, we're reverting the extra physical attack damage granted by his ultimate.
- Devour: Removed the increase in attack damage that you gain from channeling the ultimate.

Doctor Repulsor
+ Doctor Repulsor has always experienced some difficulties getting to 6 but still lacked some power even after achieving level 6. We've added a bit of power to his early game ultimate while keeping his late game power the same.
- Ludicrous Speed: Increased the speed from 1250/1875/2500 to 1500/2000/2500

Ellonia
+ Ellonia truly shines with her stacks of frost when she can land consecutive hits of her abilities. While we like the high skill shot play style that Ellonia provides, we feel that difficulty of landing Glacial Spike was too high.
- Glacial Spike: Increased the speed of the projectile from 1000 to 1100
- Glacial Spike: Increased the touch radius from 90 to 110

Engineer
+ Engineer has always been able to engage with very little risk. Considering the most optimal position of his abilities is still on the other side of enemies, we wanted to keep the ranges high but decided to tone it down a bit.
- The Keg: Lowered cast range from 800 to 750
- Steam Turret: Lowered cast range from 800 to 750
- Steam Turret: Each charge has it's own timer instead of fully refreshing the slow

Glacius
+ Tundra Blast's cast range combined with it's radius has allowed for some incredible initiations. We're reducing the range to require Glacius to be more considerate of his positioning.
- Tundra Blast: Decreased range from 700 to 600
- Ice Imprisonment: Now allows turning

Geomancer
+ With the popularity of increase in movement speed items and abilities, we've found Earth's Grasp to be irrelevant too early in the game. we're increasing the movement speed require to avoid the damage from Earth's Grasp to keep it relevant for a longer period in the game.
- Earth's Grasp: Increased radius from 180 to 195 (now requires over 390 Movement Speed to avoid)

Night Hound
+ Night Hound's new found power from his recent changes to his ultimate has made him a bit problematic. We appreciate the addition of his new ultimate so we're taking a look at some of the frustration the hero creates. we're toning down the disruptive radius of Smoke Bomb in team fights at the later stages without affecting his early game too much. we're also putting a greater emphasis on the choice for enemy players to fight the Night Hound head on or flee at the cost of bonus backstab damage.
- Magic armor reduced from 5.75 to 5
- Agility gain reduced from 2.9 to 2.5
- Smoke Bomb: No longer reduces attack speed
- Smoke Bomb: Radius reduced from 250/275/300/325 to 275
- Smoke Bomb: Cooldown increased from 15 to 30/25/20/15 seconds
- Pounce: Will now always appear between you and the target instead of always behind the target
- Invisibility: Reduced agility per level from 6/12/18 to 5/10/15

Kraken
+ In addition to his recent buffs, we've felt that Kraken could still use a tiny push. Kraken can now be more aggressive with harass damage in lane with his splash attack.
- Splash: reduced cooldown from 11/10/9/8 to 10/9/8/7

Maliken
+ An old time favorite and an icon in the game, Maliken has fallen off the charts through time. we're putting emphasis on his concept as a carry with increased power at high risk, forcing enemies to finish him off at low health or be punished by his potential.
- Increases starting strength by 1
- Hellbourne Zeal: increased max charges from 100 to 120
- Possession: Increased fear duration from 1/1.5/2 to 1.5/1.75/2
- Enchanted Flames: Reduces the damage taken on self from 6,9,12,15 to 4,8,12,16
- Enchanted Flames: Increases bonus attack damage from 10,20,30,40 to 12,24,36,48

Parasite
+ Draining Venom has been adding a lot of late game damage to Parasite, allowing him to burst most enemies regardless of the length of the game. Alongside our directional changes to reduce unskilled burst, we're removing the bonus damage granted from items and creating more decisions for the Parasite in his item choice rather than always killing your target with codex.
- Draining Venom: No longer works on any items.
- Face Hug: No longer transfers any buffs or debuffs on magic immune targets. Will still transfer Protective Charm from Jeraziah to self then apply debuffs.

Predator
+ Predator's new found strength from Elder Parasite and reworked Terror has made him extremely difficult to deal with. We find the changes to Terror to be more enjoyable than the previous implementation but we feel its about time to tone it down a bit. we're increasing the counter play around the activation of Terror by requiring more attacks and reducing his early game stats.
- Decreased starting strength from 25 to 23
- Increased strength gain from 2.4 to 2.5
- Movement Speed reduced from 300 to 295
- Terror: Increased the amount of attacks to activate from 3 to 4

Prisoner
+ Prisoner is still relatively new and while we don't want to hit him too hard. We've found that the combination of his tankiness and lethality early game is too high. Lowering his armor to make him more vulnerable to harass damage and lowering the impact of Shackled at the early levels. we're refocusing some of the free activation damage from Prison Break and putting a larger emphasis on the trigger damage for Prisoner while granting a larger reward for enemy counter play.
- Starting Armor lowered from 1.10 to 0.60 (total armor from 3.5 to 3.0)
- Shackled: Slow decreased from 30% to 20,25,30,35%
- "Target Closest" activation has been removed
- Prison Break: Initial damage reduced from 150,225,300 to 100,150,200
- Prison Break: Trigger damage increased from 150,200,300 to 200,300,400

Puppet Master
+ We feel Puppet Master has fallen behind in his carry potential compared to some other favorites due to his previous nerfs. Rather than increasing his already incredibly long disables, we've put a larger emphasis on his WhipLash allowing him to enjoy the uses of Assassin's Shroud wiping creep waves much earlier in the game.
- Increased starting damage by 2
- Whiplash: Reducing charges from 5 to 4
- Whiplash: Increasing critical damage from 1.25,1.5,1.75,2.0 to 1.5,1.75,2.0,2.25
- Voodoo Puppet: Increased damage amplification from the Puppet from 140,160,180% to 150,170,190%

Rhapsody
+ Dance Floor has always ideally wanted to be placed on the other side of the enemy to gain the most benefit. An increase in cast range will feel much better for Rhapsody when used in combination with Staccato.
- Increased the cast range of dance floor from 500 to 600. Feels much better with the use of her stun

Riftwalker
+ Riftwalker is perceived as a weaker support in exchange for what she provides in the later stages of the game being one of the few support initiators. We've toned down some of her harsh level and gold requirements making it less punishing to play the support role.
- Increasing Starting Magic Armor from 5.75 to 6.0
- Wormhole: Lowered the mana cost at all levels from 150/200/250 to 125/175/225
- Shared Existence: Reduces cooldown from 20,16,12,8 to 10

Sandwraith
+ We've found Sand Wraith to have a significant increase in strength due to the recent emphasis on hero bounties and cooldown reductions to Mirage. We like the opportunity and action that his global presence creates so instead we've lowered his early game tankiness a bit making him more manageable in lane. Desert's Curse is also getting a significant decrease in the lingertime putting more meaning on the placement both for the Sand Wraith and enemies.
- Reduced starting strength from 19 to 17
- Desert's Curse: Reduced the linger time of the debuff slow from Desert's Curse from 3 seconds to 1 second.

The Madman
+ The cooldown of stalk was initially increased due to the frustration that The Madman created. With the recent buffs to his counters like Dust of Revelation, Wards of Sight and Puzzle Box. We are comfortable with a revert to his previous changes.
- Stalk: Reduced cooldown from 10/9/8/7 to 9/8/7/6

Soulstealer
+ SoulStealer, an old time favorite has lost a lot of his appeal. The recent changes to mitigate his soul loss mechanic we feel was the wrong way to go, it ended up removing the counter play involved and lost a lot of meaning of the skill. Instead we're bringing back the risk and reward of the skill and even putting a greater emphasis on the mechanic. Soulstealer will now be able to reach higher peaks while also putting more emphasis on his death.
- Demon Hand: Reduced the mana cost from 80 to 75
- Soulsteal: Increased the maximum number of souls from 8,15,23,30 to 10,20,30,40(damage potential of Soul Burst remains the same)
- Soulsteal: Death reduction changed from 1/3 to 1/2
- Soul Burst: Increased the movement speed slow from 15,20,25% to 25%
- Soul Burst: Increases the base damage reduction from -15,-20,-25% to -25%


== Bug Fixes and Optimizations ==

Circe
- Fixed cast range indicators on Doppelganger and Twisted Visage
- Entrapment can now properly be cast near the edge of the map
- Entrapment can no longer be used on heroes who are magic immune

== New Content ==

- Added new Circe the Deceiver Debut Edition Alt Avatar: Poison Circe
* The Deceiver takes many forms, and her appearance known as Poison Circe is rumored to have been born in the Garden of Eden, a land she considered her own before those two interlopers arrived. Since then her toxic charade has been the downfall of many utopias.
* Releases 9/25/2013

- Added new Circe the Deceiver Premium Alt Avatar: Iron Maiden
* When the ship's wreckage washed ashore on Circe's island prison in the 8th century, the one item that held her fascination seemed to be a sort of man-sized jail cell lined with iron spikes. She mimicked its form and function and eagerly awaited the opportunity to enjoy it with a human. The next sailors who set foot on her sands did not savor it nearly as much as she did.
* Releases 9/25/2013

- Added new Ophelia Ultimate Alt Avatar: Sylvia
* Daughter of Circe the Deceiver, mother of Ophelia, and bane of Maliken Grimm, the mystical shapeshifter Sylvia has emerged from the darkest forests of Caldavar to stand with her Beasts and her cherished bloodline against the Hellbourne.

* Releases 9/30/2013

- Added new Blacksmith Alt Avatar: Ogre Blacksmith
* Brilliant, but lacking common sense; lazy, but compelled to forge; the Ogre Magi is a walking contradiction, and he likes being that way! If he didn't also hate being that way, of course. Infusing elemental magic into his hammers, this tiny monster brings the pain to his enemies with a frozen blast. Or a fiery barrage. Or with a little luck, total annihilationâ€¦ Not that he believes in luck, or anything.
* Releases 10/2/2013

- Added new Pebbles Alt Avatar: Earthroc Pebbles
* The south of Caldavar is littered with the remains of monasteries and forgotten architecture long lost to the sands of time.

HoN 3.2 - Salomon's Fortune
-------------
== General ==

+ The primary focus of this patch is to continue to diversify our hero pool, making each hero exciting and different to play. The secondary focus of the patch is continuing to make Heroes of Newerth the most balanced MOBA in the world both in the competitive scene and the public scene. 

Mid Wars
+ The rune spawning in the middle helps to enforce action and overall more enjoyment in the mode, have a good time! The gold changes to Mid-Wars makes it so the same amount of total gold is given to your team but also spread more evenly between your allies.
- Picking phase has been changed so every player gets 1 Blind Ban instead of Blue and Pink getting 3 Blind Bans each
- Flat Hero bounty decreased from 400 to 300
- Assist gold increased from 50% to 100% of the Hero bounty
- Hero bounty per level decreased from 10 to 7
- Hero bounty gold per streak decreased from 100 to 75
- Rune spawn location has been moved much closer to the middle

New Picking Mode: Captain's Pick

- Will be using in all competitive games along with Tournament Rules, replacing Lock Pick
- Relies heavily on the Captains of each team picking and counter-picking wisely
* Captains ban or pick one hero at a time
* The order goes: 2 bans, 3 picks, 3 bans, 2 picks

- Added a new "Tournament Stats" tab to the "View Statistics" screen
* This will display any recent events the player has participated in using the HoNTour automated tournament system


== Heroes ==

The following Heroes are now allowed in Tournament Rules games:
- Prisoner 945
- Sir Benzington

The following Heroes are no longer allowed in Tournament Rules games:
- Artillery

Accursed
+ Allowing Sear to apply on ability use will no longer force Accursed into auto attacking in order to gain the benefits of his passive.
- Cauterize: Now applies Sear debuff to enemies and Sear Buff to Allies
- Fire Shield: When it explodes, it now applies Sear buff to Allies and Sear debuff to Enemies in the radius
- Flame Consumption: Now applies Sear buff to yourself on use

Artillery
+ Artillery now focuses as a long range ability carry. He has three extremely long range abilities that either become harder to hit or less effective the closer you are to Artillery. To help keep his focus on abilities instead of auto attacks, his attack range has also been decreased.
- Reduced starting attack range from 550 to 450
- LRM: Range decreased from 1500 to 1200
- LRM: Damage changed from 15 plus 7/14/21/28% of Attack Damage to 12 plus 7/14/21/28% of Attack Damage

- Chain Spike: No longer gets removed by Magic Immunity, but will be removed by Physical Immunity

- Quicken: Now passively increases the Movement Speed cap for Blitz by 20/40/60/80
- Pilfering: Lowered Cast Time from 1 second to .6 seconds
* This does not change how quickly you cast Pilfering, just the total Casting Time

Corrupted Disciple
+ Corrupted Conduit now has a much better use by only allowing it to be disabled by range. This allows better interaction between Corrupted Disciple and his enemies with Corrupted Conduit.
- Increased starting damage by 3
- Corrupted Conduit: Casttype changed from Magic to Physical
- Corrupted Conduit: Reduced Cast Action Time from 500 to 400
- Corrupted Conduit: Now can only be removed by getting out of he 700 range

- Willowmaker: Increased cooldown from 85/75/65 to 100/85/70

Doctor Repulsor
+ These changes are to address his early game difficulties - being too fragile - before learning Ludicrous Speed. More durable, faster movement, and longer vision from Magnetic Contraption all help him.
- Starting Strength increased from 17 to 19
- Base Movement Speed increased from 295 to 305
- Magnetic Contraption: Lifetime increased from 12 to 16 seconds

- Mass Control: On use, will pick up the closest 3,5,7 things in 1,000 radius rather than the target area
- Mass Control: Cast Range of second activation increased from 600 to 750

Lord Salforis
+ Focusing Lord Salforis to be a better anti-healer. Mors Certissima will no longer be hard countered by Magic Armor and also reducing healing on targets.

Adjusted some values with Undying for better usability.
- Mors Certissima: Health regained by the target decreased from 20/40/60/80 Health over 5 seconds to 20% of damage done over 5 seconds
- Mors Certissima: Now also reduces Healing the target receives by 50% for 5 seconds

Each charge grants Salforis 5 damage and 2 Attack Speed. Using the ability again will consume the charges. Each charge heals you for 50 hit points (Thus you can heal for half of the target's Max Health)

Rampage
+ Helps greatly in preventing The Chains that Bind from ending early when his target has a Tablet used on them.
- The Chains that Bind: Break Range increased from 500 to 575 units

Ravenor
+ Harkon's gives Magic Damage on attack but what about Superior Magic damage? Ravenor's got you covered along with a significant boost to Power Overwhelming's overall potential.
- Power Overwhelming: Now causes attacks to do 100% Superior Magic damage
- Power Overwhelming: Charge cap increased from 60/90/120 to 120. Charges gained when hitting Heroes decreased from 4/6/8 to 4
- Power Overwhelming: Bonus Damage cap increased from 60/90/120 to 120/180/240. Bonus Movement Speed cap increased from 60/90/120 to 90/120/150
- Power Overwhelming: Charges lost every second increased from 5 to 8

Revenant
+ Getting Manifestation's double-cast at level 11 takes a little too long, but getting it at level 6 is a little too quick. How about level 8.
- Manifestation: Level requirements lowered from 6/11/16 to 4/8/12

Salomon
+ Salomon now brings wishes of the Djinn in the form of Wealth, Power, and Vengeance. This will allow Salomon to achieve high GPMs while having some scaling into the late game.
- Djinn Blast: Completely reworked. Now called Cosmic Cleave
* Cosmic Cleave: Dual ability. Can be cast both Close (Q) and Far (W). On use, deals (50% of your Attack Damage + 30/60/90/120) Magic Damage in front of you and slows for 15%. If you quickly hit the same target with the other Cosmic Cleave, the slow is increased to 25%.

On use the Avatar of Revenge returns to his itty-bitty living space, reverting Salomon back to his normal self

+ Slightly bringing back his jungle ability, which went a little too low with our last change.
- Graceful Strikes: Daytime Attack Damage Bonus increased from 25/40/55/70 to 35/45/55/65

+ A hero with a lot of utility that could be tuned down a notch. Removing the ability to deny at level 1 was the win-win change, since it also removes a lot of annoyances that players have when playing against the hero.
- Elemental: Level 1 of this ability can no longer be used on Allied units

Thunderbringer
+ A nice touch to Lightning Storm so Thunderbringer doesn't always feel like he never has it ready in the late game.
- Lightning Storm: Cooldown decreased from 120 to 120/110/100

Tremble
+ Removing the annoying parts of the Terror Mounds for both sides. Terror Mounds are harder to see so Tremble won't find heroes always killing them, but also made them much easier to kill so Enemy players are no longer attacking them for 2 minutes straight.

- Spirit Ward (SotM): Increased number of bounces from 0/1/0 to 0/1/2 and removed Split Shot

Version 3.1.1
-------------
== General ==

+ In HoN 3.1 - The Runic Shift we changed a monumental number of Heroes and Items, some of which need continued adjustment. Our internal testing cannot possibly mirror the sheer number of games, skill differences, and hero combinations that the community can. We are listening when you bring up potential balance issues to us. In this patch we are giving minor changes to Predator, Elder Parasite, and the Experience granted from kills. We will continue to closely monitor the changes from HoN 3.1 - The Runic Shift.


- Hero Kill Changes
+ Static Experience will remain similar to continue to incentivize ganking, but will take a slight hit to decrease snowballing. Increased gold for hero kills was not playing a larger role in snowballing, but is actually playing a larger role in comebacks with the new changes. Area Experience will take a significant hit in order to tone down the effectiveness of 5 man training, although this tactic will still be usable.
* Experience granted per kill was lowered from 100 per level to 90 per level. This Experience is divided among all nearby players
* Unsplit Experience granted per kill was lowered from 12 per level to 6 per level. This Experience is given to each nearby player
* Before with 4 players killing a level 9 hero, each Hero gets: ((100*9)/4)+(12*9)= 333 Experience
* After with 4 players killing a level 9 hero, each Hero gets: ((90*9)/4)+(6*9)= 256.5 Experience


- Predator
+ Predator gained a significantly better mana pool due to no longer needing to cast Terror. Venomous Leap now increases in Mana Cost to make up for that very large mana pool gain. Terror's buff & debuff will also last slighly less duration to allow enemies a better chance to get away.
* Venomous Leap: Manacost increased from 90 to 90/100/110/120
* Terror: Debuff on enemies duration decreased from 10 to 8 seconds
* Terror: Buff on yourself duration decreased from 4.5 seconds to 3.5 seconds


- Elder Parasite
+ Elder parasites offensive side has been on the high end, so we've toned the Attack Speed back to that of the original Elder Parasite by removing 15 from the activation.
* Attack Speed during activation decreased from 100 to 85

HoN 3.1.0.1
-------------
- Added Lex Talionis to Tournament Rules


HoN 3.1 - The Runic Shift
-------------
== General ==

- The Early Access Program has been suspended indefinitely
+ These changes were made in an effort to make one of our most important pieces of content, Heroes, become more creative, engaging, and exciting. While there is no longer a definitive schedule you can still expect to see new (and better!) Heroes added to the game. Also be on the lookout for more reworks due to this change in direction.
- Heroes will no longer be mandatorily created and released every 4 weeks
* Heroes are available to everyone immediately upon release

- Added new Hero: Sir Benzington
* Nimble and deadly, Benzington is a highly mobile melee ganking Hero that also gains increased attack range. Knightfall and Joust allows for engagements at incredible distances making Benzington an intimidating force anytime an enemy is spotted.
* Joust - Target a direction to dash forward up to 900 units, passing through the first enemy Hero hit and stopping. Enemies hit receive 100/170/240/310 Magic Damage and a 0.7 second stun.
* Royal Stomp - Activate to pull all nearby enemies 200/250/300/350 units towards you and reduce enemy Movement Speed by 40% for 2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds.
* Lance-A-Long - Passively increases your Attack Range by 50/100/150/200. Activate to boost your next attack to 428 range and add up to 100/180/260/340 Magic Damage. Your attacks passively build up to 5 charges, increasing the damage when you activate it.
* Knightfall - Target an enemy at considerable range to leap into the air and become invulnerable for 3 seconds. When you land, you deal 200/350/500 Magic Damage and apply a 50% tapering slow for 2 seconds in a 400/500/600 radius.
* This Hero will be released with 2 avatars. One is a Premium Alt Avatar and the other is introducing a new type of avatar called the Debut Edition (in lieu of the previous exclusive EA Alt Avatar). Debut Edition Alt Avatars are sold for a limited period of time after the release of a hero. They are not exclusively limited to that period of time and may reappear within the store at a later time.
* Releases 5/3/2013


- HoN Development Direction Shift
* Recently here at S2 Games we have gone through an internal direction shift in how we look at Heroes of Newerth. We believe that giving back to the community is the best way to serve HoN. We are looking to take more risks with our game through the support of the community; a testament to this is the fact that most of the changes in this patch have originated or been inspired by community input. This patch is designed to re-invigorate the game with some much-needed changes that promote the fast paced, action packed gameplay of Heroes of Newerth. Look forward to the continued improvement of Heroes of Newerth with the best possible service we can provide!


- Added a new Rune: Rune of Refreshment
+ The purpose of this rune is to create more contention between the rune locations while creating more action and movement from Heroes.
* Spawns at the opposite location and at the same time as the normal Rune spawn
* When picked up, this Rune will restore 135 Health and 70 Mana over 3 seconds. Dispels on damage.
* If bottled, refills the Bottle to 2/3 full
* Will not appear unless a normal Rune would as well


- New Ingame Radial Menu
+ In looking for ways to increase communication between players on a team, we found this menu will greatly improve the ability to easily and quickly communicate during intense action
* Accessed by holding ALT and then holding left click on a spot on screen, as if you were to ping it but holding down both buttons
* Easily and very quickly lets a player communicate with the rest of the team
* Players can ping map locations, signal other players to retreat, say they think there is danger, call missing, tell people they are coming to assist, and more!
* You can now mute/ignore allies by right-clicking on their portrait
* Muting/Ignoring a player will now hide all pings that player sends


- Hero Kill Changes
+ Hero kills become much more valuable throughout most stages of the game. Level 1 Hero kills remain mostly the same but after level 1, experience granted for early kills is greatly increased. Late game Hero kills give about a 33% increase in gold. Players will now be encouraged to get killing sprees rather than discouraged. Teams are now more incentivized to kill static farming Heroes instead of avoiding them.
* Increased the gold given per level of a Hero from 5 to 10
* Decreased the amount of gold given for kill streaks from 50 to 25
* Decreased the gold loss for dying from 30 to 25 per level
* Heroes will now be worth more gold depending on their GPM compared to the average GPM of the game. A Hero can be worth up to 50% more. Kill streak and first blood are not affected.
* Changed experience granted on kills from 100-2300 to 100-2500 (Area experience when multiple Heroes are around remains unchanged)
* A streak will now reduce the gold lost of the streaker by 25 per streak on his next death
* Solo Hero kills will now grant the absence of assist gold to the team (split four ways)


- Lane Dynamic
+ Lane pulling used to be mandatory. These changes will still allow a team to gain an advantage from pulling neutral creeps but it will no longer become mandatory in order to compete against another team if they are pulling. This change does not affect player controlled Neutrals.
* Melee Lane Creeps increased damage they do to Neutrals from 125% to 150%
* Ranged Lane Creeps increased damage they do to Neutrals from 75% to 150%
* Uncontrolled Neutral creeps damage reduced to Lane Creeps by roughly 50%
* Lane Creeps will no longer be able to be pulled to multiple Neutral camps
* When a player takes control of a Lane or Neutral creep, the damage they do to each other is reverted to the normal values


- Ancients
+ Making Ancients somewhat harder to kill will increase the length of time when a team or player can effectively do them. Going this route instead of reducing their reward still allows ancients to be an effective boost in terms of gold and experience. The Predasaurs getting more Movement Speed also helps to make them more of a threat and not as easily kited.
* Predasaur Crusher: Movement Speed increased from 300 to 350
* Predasaur Crusher: Armor increased from 4.12 to 8
* Predasaur: Movement Speed increased from 270 to 350
* Predasaur: Health increased from 675 to 800
* Predasaur: Armor increased from 2.94 to 3.5
* Dragon Master: Magic Armor increased from 10 to 12
* Dragon: Magic Armor increased from 5.5 to 8


- Bosses
+ Due to our past buffs to Kongor, we are no longer worried about the extra damage illusions bring to killing this boss. This also fixes the issue where picking up the Rune of Power in Mid Wars and the other boss instantly killing your illusions.
* Kongor, Transmutanstein, and Zorgath will no longer instantly kill illusions that attack them


- Abilities now show their Mana Costs on the Ability icon
+ After seeing the popularity of a UI modification and consistent frequency of requests for this feature, we have now made it a part of the standard UI. Thanks for your input and feedback!
* This works for split and multi-abilities as well


== Heroes ==

- The main focus of the following changes are to promote roaming and ganking. Some secondary focuses are increasing the viability of more items/Heroes and making them more enjoyable to play with.

Added to Tournament Rules
- Oogie
- Solstice
- Pearl
- Grinex
- Lodestone
- Bushwack

Amun-Ra
+ Draining Ra's Mana is no longer a hard counter to Pyroclasmic Rebirth but still remains a soft counter. Pyroclasmic Rebirth also has such a huge cooldown that you can rarely get two off when going from levels 6 to 11. The reduction should help with the feel of not having an ultimate if it goes off at 6 and also with the viability of the Hero in competitive play.
- Pyroclasmic Rebirth: Cooldown decreased from 300/220/140 to 210/150/90
- Pyroclasmic Rebirth: Ra now always revives with 10% Health plus 1% for each 1% Mana he has left up to 50%. Max revive Health is 60%.

Armadon
+ Overall this change leaves Armadon with a better feel while playing him and against him. You can no longer get the angle barely wrong or right, and you no longer have 249 damage build up on Armordillo only to get nuked and gain 1 damage from it.
- Armordillo: 11.25/22.5/33.75/45% damage reduction now smoothly scales based off the angle you get hit from 0 to 95 degrees. Damage reduction is drastically reduced the closer you get to 95 degrees
- Armordillo: Charges are now gained if Armordillo reduces damage and more charges will be gained the closer to your back
* Example: 100% charges gained at less than 5 degrees, 95% charges at less than 15 degrees, down to 0 at 95 degrees
- Armordillo: Charges will now overflow to the next Spine Burst up to 250 damage

Artillery
+ This reduces LRM's total damage by about 10% late game and decreases the amount he can constantly use it in the early game, especially with Artillery's very low Intelligence. The nerf on Artillery Barrage also allows enemies to work around it when it is on cooldown.
- LRM: Reduce damage from 15+10/17/24/31% to 15+7/14/21/28%
- LRM: Increased Mana cost from 80/85/90/95 to 80/90/100/110
- Artillery Barrage: Cooldown increased from 90/80/70 to 120/100/80 seconds

Blitz
+ Quicken now becomes a counter to slows rather than slows countering Quicken.
- Quicken: Movement Speed increased from 100% to 100/150/200/250%

Bramble
+ A relatively hard ability to land in the first place and making its rewards more apparent early seemed very appropriate. This also can allow Bramble the ability to go 1 point into Spore Breath and max his other skills for a new and different build.
- Spore Breath: Stun duration increased from 1/1.25/1.5/1.75 to 1.75 seconds

Defiler
+ Her cast type will now work like many other line skills. This should help increase her ability to hit Wave of Death
- Wave of Death: Cast targeting changed to Target Dual

Devourer
+ This will prevent the target from being Tableted or affected by other movement abilities such as Compel. The Devourer himself can still be Tableted to break Devour... unless he is Magic Immune, of course.
- Devour: Now Immobilizes the target

Draconis
+ Punishes Draconis players who waste/use their ultimate at bad times by lowering its uptime.
- Cataclysmic Assault: Cooldown increased from 60/45/30 to 75/60/45 seconds

Drunken Master
+ You are no longer required to drink! This will make the Hero less tedious and more fun to play. This also allows him to retain more Mana or burst heal, making it a decent buff.
- Drink: Reduced Mana cost from 50 to 35/40/45/50
- Drink: Reworked to now passively give charges up to 3/5/7/9 and gives one charge every 4.5/4/3.5/3 seconds
- Drink: Drink can now be activated to channel (drink) all charges for 25 Health per charge

Engineer
+ This will allow Heroes with Magic Immune spells to no longer have to pick up Shrunken Heads in order to pass through Energy Field.
- Energy Field: Fence no longer works on any Magic Immune target instead of just Shrunken Head
* Still dispels Protective Charm

Electrician
+ Allows Cleansing Shock to have more uses in countering other Heroes.
- Staff of the Master upgrade: Once again causes the shock effect to chain to 2 nearby targets
* Chains to allies if you target an ally and enemies if you target an enemy

Ellonia
+ Reducing the high Mana usage the Hero currently has. Increased stun range in order to fit her other long range skills and allow Ellonia to make better use of it.
- Frigid Field: Mana cost reduced from 70/80/90/100 to 75 at all levels
- Flash Freeze: Cast range increased from 500 to 500/550/600/650
- Absolute Zero: Mana cost decreased from 150/250/350 to 150/200/250

Fayde
+ Slow no longer goes through Magic Immunity. Fayde didn't need any other adjustments after the changes to Revelation Wards, Bound Eye, and Puzzlebox
- Deep Shadows: No longer Superior Magic

Flint Beastwood
+ Bringing back one of the most famous carry Heroes in the game by allowing his laning phase to have more presence.

- Money Shot: Break range increased from 1800/2300/2800 to 2300/2550/2800

+ Increasing the viability of Grapple. Gauntlet will no longer become very ineffective as the game gets past the laning phase.
- Grapple: Increased travel distance from 800 to 800/900/1000/1100
- Grapple: Decreased fly distance from 800/950/1100/1250 to 800/900/1000/1100

Gemini
+ Remade Gemini's third skill, which will now improve with your stats! A percentage of these bonuses will also apply to Fire and Ice.

* Elemental Force: Gains up to 1 Armor Penetration for every 16/14/12/10 points of Strength

- Crystal Field: Delay normalized from 3/2.75/2.5 to 2.5 at all levels
- Crystal Field: Radius increased from 300 at all levels to 350

Gladiator
+ Allowing Gladiator a better lane presence to compete against other solo laners.
- Flagellation: Cooldown reduced from 16/12/8/4 to 10/8/6/4

Gunblade
+ Grappling Shot is much more usable in the early levels while also lasting long enough for Gunblade to get the full effects. Crippling Slugs will now hit mechanical units as well. 
- Crippling Slugs: Now damages catapults
- Grappling Shot: Range increased from 500/600/700 to 600/650/700
- Grappling Shot: Armor Debuff increased from 5 to 8 seconds

Hellbringer
+ Hellbringer will have a much better uptime on his disable. Life Void in the early levels will now combo much better with Death Boil. Malphas uptime can now compare with many other ultimates in the game as it is mainly used as a counter pick and it is no longer hard countered by Nullfire Blade since you have 3.
- Unholy Shackles: Cooldown reduced from 15 to 12 seconds
- Life Void: Duration increased from 5.5/7/8.5/10 to 7/8/9/10 seconds
- Summon Malphas: Cooldown lowered from 160/150/140 to 160/140/120 seconds
- Summon Malphas: Increased the amount of Malphas Demons summoned from 1 to 1/2/3
* Stats of Malphas are changed to be slightly higher than an old level 1 Malphas
* Different Malphas Demons' abilities now stack with each other (Example: Immolation)

Keeper of the Forest
+ Reduced Keeper's effective health against Physical attacks to make him a little easier to kill. Also gave Nature's Veil a fade time so the enemy can react better to it and won't miss attacks as often in lane. Root having the higher cooldown will force Keeper to think a little bit more before using it whenever late game.
- Agility Gain lowered from 2.0 to 1.7
- Nature's Veil: Reduced Armor gain from 6/8/10/12 to 4/6/8/10
- Nature's Veil: Now has a .25 second fade time before stealth
- Root: Cooldown increased from 120/110/100 to 120 seconds

Kraken
+ Giving Kraken a little of his power back while also allowing him to have a better chance to cast all three abilities at level 6. The Intelligence buff is larger than it appears to be. Try it out!
- Starting Armor increased from 2.1 to 3.1
- Intelligence gain per level increased from 1.7 to 2.0
- Splash: Damage increased from 20/40/60/80 to 25/45/65/85

Lodestone
+ One more notch down for Lodestone and should help keep him from comboing as much in the early game.
- Shatterstorm: Cooldown increased from 80/70/60 to 100/80/60

Madman
+ This rework allows Madman to effectively get 54% more damage. Also fits with Berserk, giving him increased attack speed. This allows Madman to really be able to focus down and kill a single target faster and more consistently. This buff also allows Madman to go Riftshards and really be a force to reckon with for DPS.
- Gash: Adds 6/7/8/9% bonus damage per attack on a target up to 3/4/5/6 times
- Gash: No longer gives Critical Strike chance

Monarch
+ Noxious Cloud used to give 800 Clearvision. Some of that is given back in a smaller radius. Cleansing Wind is now MUCH more usable and consistent. She can now be a more usable counter pick in lineups.
- Noxious Cloud: Now grants 400 radius Clearvison around itself
- Cleansing Wind: Now starts 350 units behind Monarch and travels through her to the target location
- Cleansing Wind: Increased radius from 150 to 175/200/225

Moon Queen
+ Tweaked Moon Beam in Mana cost and stun duration in order to take down some of her previously increased early laning presence. Also made her less of a base demolisher and allow teams to better spread against her Multi-strike.
- Moon Beam: Increased Mana cost from 90/100/110/120 to 120
- Moon Beam: Reduced stun duration from 1 to 0.7/0.8/0.9/1 second
- Multi-strike: Reduced bounce range from 500 to 450

Moraxus
+ Giving his tankiness more of a direction against Physical instead of Magic, allowing teams to have an easier time handling Matraxe.
- Magic Armor reduced from 5 to 4.5

Myrmidon
+ Carrying with Myrmidon is now a real thing! Get your Carridon on!
- Forced Evolution: Staff of the Master upgrade added
- Staff of the Master upgrade: On attack, now deals Magic damage and slows in a 250 radius. Increases damage from 125/175/225 to 175/225/275

Night Hound
+ Invisibility is no longer 100% countered by true vision. Now he gets an edge that he won't lose in every competitive game.
- Invisibility: Passively grants 6/12/18 Agility
- Invisibility: Fade time decreased from 3/2.5/1.5 to 2.5/2/1.5 seconds

Nomad
+ Allows enemies to work around Edge Counter a little better with the reduction to uptime.
- Edge Counter: Cooldown increased from 60/45/30 to 60/50/40 seconds

Oogie
+ This is more of a change towards Ghost Marchers. Oogie with Steamboots will still move about as fast while Oogie with Ghost Marchers will no longer be so close to Haste speed.
- Conflagrate: Movement Speed bonus changed from a flat 20/40/60/80 to a 5/10/15/20% bonus Movement Speed

Ophelia
+ Allows teams to have more of a chance to stop her pushes without needing tons of area damage. Also allows teams a better time frame to purge Judgement off Heroes or to kill them.
- Command: Bonus Health given to minions lowered from 75/150/225/300 to 40/120/160/200
- Ophelia's Judgment: Time it takes to teleport an ally back to the fountain increased from 6/5/4/3 seconds to 5.5/5/4.5/4 seconds
- Ophelia's Touch: No longer heals Neutrals to full. Instead, it heals triple the amount (600/900/1200)

Pandamonium
+ This will prevent the target from being Tableted or affected by other movement abilities such as Compel. Pandamonium himself can still be Tableted to break Face Smash... unless he is Magic Immune, of course.
- Face Smash: Now Immobilizes the target

Pharaoh
+ We removed Pharaoh's ability to prevent neutrals from spawning because of his ability to do it easily from anywhere on the map and no one having the ability to stop it. It was there to prevent Pharaoh from stacking camps but it is viewed that free stacking compared to free preventing is the lesser of two evils.
- Tormented Soul: The vision no longer prevents Neutrals from spawning

Pearl
+ A slight tone down of the Pearl's pushing ability.
- Whirlbubble: Radius lowered from 300 to 275
- Preservation: Duration lowered from 8/10/12 to 7/8.5/10 seconds

Pebbles
+ Something a little fun and also can be very viable with Spellshards builds and/or new Restoration Stone builds. Enjoy!
- Enlarge: Staff of the Master upgrade added
- Staff of the Master upgrade: Turns Enlarge into Group Chuck and grants it the ability to Chuck up the 3 targets, dealing damage based on the level of Chuck
* Shares a cooldown with Chuck

Predator
+ This change allows Predator to spread Terror more consistantly and more often while giving  his enemies a way to deal with the ability.
- Terror: Now passive
* After attacking the same target 3 times, that target gets -2/4/6 Armor for 10 seconds
* Allies who attack that target gain 20/40/60 Attack speed and 15% Movement Speed for 4.5 seconds

Puppet Master
+ True to its name, Voodoo Puppet really does function like a voodoo doll now, transferring any negative effects like DoTs, Stuns, and other disables to the afflicted player. Puppet can also use his Puppeteer's Hold and Puppet Show on the Voodoo Puppet, which will also transfer to the target.
- Voodoo Puppet: Cooldown reduced from 150 to 150/135/120
- Voodoo Puppet: Debuffs will now also transfer to the target
* Using a channel ability such as Devourer's Devour or Pollywog Priest's Tongue Tied on the Voodoo Puppet will stun the target for the duration of the channel
* Will not stun the target or transfer debuffs to them if they become Magic Immune while tied to the Voodoo Puppet

Revenant
+ Revenant will now be able to affect the entire ally team!
- Manifestation: Staff of the Master upgrade added
- Staff of the Master upgrade: Abilities affect two additional targets
* Abilities will cast on 3/4/5 targets total

Riftwalker
+ Allows a much better feel when used in combination with her other two skills. No longer feels awkward when trying to land all three.
- Riftburn: Cast range increased from 600 to 700

Slither
+ Bringing back some of his old lane strength and ability to kill targets once in a while even when they Homecoming Stone out.
- Toxicity: Illusions will only apply Toxicity for 33% of the duration
- Toxicity: Reduced Health Regeneration increased from 20/40/60/80% to 30/50/70/90%
- Toxicity: Duration increased from 7 to 8 seconds
- Toxicity: Now decreases Movement Speed by 1.25/2.5/3.75/5%

Silhouette
+ Gives Silhouette slightly less laning presence in the early game, while not changing her late game attack speed bonus very much.
- Relentless Salvo: Attack Speed bonus decreased from 250/300/350/400% to 150/200/250/300%

Soul Reaper
+ Inhuman Nature now has a use when you are at full Mana. Store up extra charges in order to expend them later or give an ally a burst of Mana! 
- Inhuman Nature: Can now store up to 10 charges, gaining 1 charge for each creep killed and 2 for Heroes killed
* These charges may be used on self or ally to restore 12/24/36/48 Mana per charge
* May also be right-clicked to put it on autocast. While on autocast, you will instantly consume charges for yourself and not build up charges

Succubus
+ This will prevent the target from being Tableted or affected by other movement abilities such as Compel. Succubus herself can still be Tableted to break Succubus' Hold... unless she is Magic Immune, of course.
- Succubus' Hold: Now Immobilizes the target

Swiftblade
+ Swiftblade will no longer have his late game severely hurt while spinning.
- Blade Frenzy: No longer disarms or slows Swiftblade's attack speed
- Blade Frenzy: Now will reduce attack damage while spinning by 30/20/10/0%
* He still cannot Critical Strike while spinning

Tempest
+ Making his Elementals comparable to other minions that can't attack towers.
- Elemental: Minions no longer attack Towers when Tempest is out of range

Valkyrie
+ Valkyrie's Javelin not only gets a partial revert to get some of her power back, but also gets even better by level four. Early levels of Javelin will enjoy the benefits of getting longer stuns since they are no longer handled in segments of 0.5 seconds. Leap is more consistent and reduces some of the feeling of doom when you use your Leap once in the early game.
- Javelin of Light: Made the stun increments better from 225/200/175/150 to 200/175/150/125
- Javelin of Light: Stun is now handled dynamically
* If you land a level 4 Javelin at 225 range you will now get a 0.9 second stun instead of a 0.5 second stun
- Courageous Leap: Cooldown lowered from 40/35/30/20 to 35/30/25/20

Vindicator
+ From Vindicator's last rework, he was no longer an easy counter pick but, as expressed by the community, he lost a lot of viability. A middle ground was found where Vindicator's old presence could still be felt while also making it so he isn't an automatic counter to so many Heroes.
- Magic Armor increased from 6 to 7
- Master's Incarnation: Reduced Cooldown from 2/1/0/0 to 2/0/0/0
- Glyph of Silence Reworked: On use, drops a Totem at your feet that will Silence enemies within 800 units of it when they cast spells. Totem takes 2/2/3/3 hits to kill, lasts 8/12/16/20 seconds, and silences for 1.5/2/2/2.5 seconds
* Vindicator still gets 10/20/30/40 Attack Speed passively when leveling this skill

Wildsoul
+ Allows Wildsoul to still compete against Heroes at level 3 but makes early lucky roots less devastating.
- Booboo: Changed Entangling Claws duration on Heroes from 3 seconds to 0/2/2.5/3 seconds

Witch Slayer
+ Allows his Staff of the Master to have some extra use other than just damage, especially if they just have Shrunken Head with no Magic Armor. Can't disable him anymore? Well, just shoot him anyway!
- Heavenly Blast: Staff of the Master updated
- Staff of the Master update: In addition to increasing the damage done, the upgrade also changes damage type from Magic to Superior Magic


== Items ==

Added to Tournament Rules
- Dawnbringer
- Frozenlight
- Searinglight
- Lightbrand
- Grimoire of Power

Chests
+ Items that enemies cannot use will be unable to be seen by the enemy when dropped. This is done in order to help prevent trolling and games being decided by something so small.
- Items you own on the ground in a Chest are now invisible to the enemy players
- Chests now have a new larger glow effect to make them easier to spot
- Chests with items owned by your team are now visible through fog at all times

NEW ITEM: Lex Talionis
+ Focused more as an offensive support item to help take down 1 enemy hero. Also makes for one of the few early game items that offers regeneration for supports. Ganker Heroes may find this item useful as well but the debuff to yourself hopes to focus it more towards supports wanting to be offensive.
- New Item added to Supportive
- Requires Trinket of Restoration, Guardian Ring, and a 300 gold recipe
- Can be upgraded 3 times
- Passively gives 3/4/5 Armor, 1/2/3 Magic Armor, 2.5/3/3.5 Health Regeneration
- Activate to apply a debuff to yourself and the target enemy that reduces armor by 3/4/5 and Magic Armor by 1/2/3 for 7 seconds
- 750 Cast range, 50 Mana cost. Physical cast type
* Does not activate Nullstone

Abyssal Skull
+ Abyssal Skull uses Trinket of Restoration in the recipe but never before gained the benefits of that item. Now you get to keep that Regeneration. The small reduction in damage and Lifesteal is to reduce how effective this item becomes in the late stages of the game for its cost.
- Reduced Lifesteal aura from 15% to 12%
- Reduced Base Damage increase from 15% to 12%
- Now provides 2 Health Regeneration

Bottle
+ This change makes bottling a rune much easier and more intuitive to do.
- Can now right click Runes to automatically fill your bottle with the Rune
* If you already have a Rune bottled, will use the rune normally instead
* Will bottle a rune if you right click it regardless of how full the Bottle is. Charges left in the Bottle are lost
* You can bottle a Rune by right clicking it while the Bottle is on cooldown

Bound Eye
+ This change will bring back skill and foresight to support players in the late game both for warding and de-warding. Now that Bound Eye is not the end-all be-all ward clearer, good support players will now be able to shine over other support players.
- No longer sees Wards by default
- Can now be activated to reveal all Wards through fog around the user for 10 seconds, 60 seconds cooldown. Will break invisibility on self when activated.
- Added a visual passive and active effect to the targets possessing Bound Eye

Courier
+ Courier will now be unable to scout for free at the start of the game and most players will have an easier time killing it. This will also help to keep the Courier from feeding in the late game from just 1 attack. Because of the Chest changes, items that enemies cannot use will be unable to be seen by them when dropped. This was done in order to help prevent trolling and games being decided upon something so small.
- Invulnerability cooldown increased from 20 seconds to 90 seconds
- When the Courier gets upgraded to a Flying Courier the Invulnerability will start on cooldown
- If the courier dies, all items will be dropped normally. However, only consumables and shareable items that are dropped can be seen by enemies. The rest are invisible to enemies.
- The Flying Courier now dies in 2 hits by melee Heroes, 3 hits by ranged Heroes or Towers, and 6 hits from minions.

Dust of Revelation
+ Dust will now have a greater use in the game. Players also now have a way of finding enemies hiding in the woods now.
- Reduced cooldown from 60 to 30 seconds
- You can see any enemy hit though fog for 3 seconds

Elder Parasite
+ Moving Elder Parasite from being an extremely niche item and opening up the amount of Heroes that can use it with the large health boost and no longer being an attack modifier. Elder Parasite's increased strength is geared towards competing with Shrunken Head in terms of viability.
- Now requires Gloves of the Swift, Beastheart, and a 400 cost recipe
- Passively gives 250 Health and 15 Attack Speed
- Activate to give 20% Lifesteal, 20% Movement Speed, and 100 Attack Speed for 12 seconds. Applies 15% damage amp to yourself still.
- Is now an Activation Modifier and cannot be activated while effects from Shrunken Head or Void Talisman are active
- Removed from Morph Attack and now in Combative shop
- No Longer an Attack Modifier

Hellflower
+ Instead of reducing all of Hellflower's benefits to the point of uselessness, we removed the damage amp in order to keep more lockdown item choices in the game. Players already have choices for amplifying their damage, but very few choices in locking down a target.
- Removed damage amp
- Cast range increased from 800 to 900
- Increased duration from 4 to 4.5 seconds
- Reduced Mana cost from 200 to 150

Homecoming Stone
+ Right now, counter teleports happen too fast for a team to viably try to gank an enemy hero. The increased duration will allow teams a chance to gank enemies at towers while also still allowing the enemy team a chance to react. The increased duration also makes it much more viable to run when you see a port coming, try and port out yourself, or to man up and kill the tower.
- It now takes 4 seconds to teleport to any level 1 Tower, 3.5 seconds to any level 2 Tower, and 3 seconds to anything inside your base.
* Post Haste is still a 3 second channel to anything
- New effects for the target of a teleport
* These effects show how long it will be until the person teleporting in will appear

Nome's Wisdom
+ Nome's now becomes an extra choice to get Mana regeneration for your team and becomes more usable in more situations
- 50% Mana regeneration is now applied on the aura

Post Haste
+ You no longer lose out on the bonus Movement Speed Striders gives you when you upgrade to Post Haste. Post Haste now gives up to 150 total Movement Speed, just like Striders.
- Now gains additional +45 Movement Speed over 8 seconds when out of combat

Puzzlebox
+ The biggest part of the Puzzlebox change comes from the fact that reveal is now on level 1 and 2. This goes along with the Bound Eye change in order to give players another option to clear wards effectively in an area, but obviously comes at a much greater cost. The rest of the changes help to remedy how ineffective the combat of level 1 and level 2 Puzzlebox minions are in comparison to the level 3 minions.
- Strength increased from 6/10/14 to 9/12/15
- Intelligence changed from 15/21/24 to 15/20/25
- Puzzlebox Mauler: Movement Speed increased from 330/360/390 to 350/370/390
- Puzzlebox Mauler: Damage increased from 21/41/61 to 25/50/75
- Puzzlebox Mauler Manaburn: Damage dealt increased from 60% to 100% of the Mana burn
- Puzzlebox Mauler Revealing Eye: Radius increased from 0/0/1000 to 300/650/1000
- Puzzlebox Wizard: Movement Speed increased from 330/360/390 to 350/370/390
- Puzzlebox Wizard: Damage increased from 31/61/91 to 40/65/90
- Puzzlebox Wizard Haste Aura: Radius increased from 350 to 600

Restoration Stone
+ Not only will this change open up new Heroes to use Restoration Stone, but it will also likely make new Heroes usable due to their abilities having smaller cooldowns.
- Cooldown is now based on the cooldown of all abilities/items refreshed plus 30 seconds. Max of 210 second cooldown
* Example: Tempest uses only his level 1 Elemental Void and then waits 80 seconds (120 seconds left on cooldown). He then uses Portal Key (14 second cooldown), Meteor (25 second cooldown), and then uses Restoration Stone. Restoration Stone's cooldown will then be 120+14+25+30=209 seconds

Wards of Revelation
+ The biggest reason for Revelation Wards being unavailable at the start was because of neutral creep pulling being so strong. Revelation Wards are brought back with the new lane dynamic change since there is no longer a large enough reason to have them removed. Being worth some gold now helps with the ward battles.
- Two can now be purchased at the start of the game
- Now worth 25 gold when killed
- You can now see the radius around neutral camps that would block respawns when you're placing a ward (Both Wards of Revelation and Wards of Sight)

Riftshards
+ Better and more reliable in the early game while still being the large damage in the end game.
- Critical Chance increased from 10/13/16/20% to 20%
- Critical Damage decreased slightly from 1.8/2/2.2/2.4 to 1.65/1.9/2.15/2.4
- Damage changed from 45/55/65/75 to 40/53/66/80

Ring of the Teacher
+ Gives less pushing presence in the early game while still making the item just as good for the user
- Reduced aura Armor from 3 to 2
- Passive armor increased by 1

Savage Mace
+ Taking the item down slightly in order to give other late game damage items some presence.
- Removed attack speed

Shrunken Head
+ Goes along with the new Elder Parasite change.
- Is now an Activation Modifier and cannot be activated while effects from Elder Parasite or Void Talisman are active

Steamboots
+ Allows for easier purchasing from the side shop.
- Now defaults to Apprentice Robe instead of Bolstering Armband

Slayer
+ Savage Mace damage is now the sum of its parts and also makes its buildup slightly worse
- Damage reduced from 46 to 40

Void Talisman
+ Goes along with the new Elder Parasite
- Is now an Activation Modifier and cannot be activated while effects from Elder Parasite or Shrunken Head are active

Version 2.6.21
--------------
== New Content ==

- Added new Early Access Hero: Solstice
* Among the tribes of the moon, there lives an elite caste of warriors. Like Krixi, the Moon Queen, these women draw their power from the rays of Lunari. As children of the Moon Goddess, the rays of Sol burn their flesh and forces them to construct a vessel to channel Lunari's might during the day. The magicks used were so potent that only a chosen warrior, born in perfect balance between light and darkness, could harness its vast power by being forever bonded to her armor. The armor serves as a disguise to men and beasts who would would take advantage of her during the day, masking both her power and gender. In the night, the chosen can retake her true form and strike from the shadows, free from her confining shell. Be it through strength by day or stealth by night, Solstice, the Lady of Lunari, stands ready to show her enemies what power truly is.

* Solstice changes her role from a more tanky, team-fight presence during the day, to an agile ganker during the night. Look for ways to setup your ultimate from outside of enemy's vision range in order to deal the maximum damage!

- Added new Limited Edition Early Access Solstice Alt Avatar: Mr. Tickles
* In the darkened streets of the City of Iron there are rumors of a killer stalking the women of Newerth. This insidious predator hides behind a veneer of gentlemanly graciousness in the evening hours and truly despises the actions that he must take to quell the horrific urges that tear at the back of his mind. The promise of relief led the brilliant, deranged man to craft a potion to heal himself. While it took away the urge to kill, it transformed him into a brute during the day, desperately striving for acceptance, but attacked by the townsfolk who see and fear him as a Hellbourne demon. With neither day nor night to bring him respite all he can do is laugh. And the last things his victims will ever hear is,"Don't worry, this will just tickle a bit..."

- Added new Premium Solstice Alt Avatar: Duel
* The Justicar had tracked the Assassin for weeks and finally had found his lair. Alone, he should have called for assistance, but he could not risk letting the demonborn bastard escape yet again. As he entered the building the full moon in the night sky began to be eclipsed, a once in a millennium event. The Justicar broke down the door, surprising the brutal killer as he prepared his blade. The assassin fled for the rooftops to escape, but the lawman bore down on him swiftly. On the roof of the building they locked into combat. In a fair fight the Justicar had the advantage of reach and armor and quickly cut the assassin down. He barely noticed the small nick from the assassin's blade on his cheek. The poison went quickly to work and although the half-demon lie dieing next to him, the Justicar fell to his knees, gasping for air. Both warriors fought to hold on to the last vestiges of life, but it faded from them just as the moon became fully eclipsed. As their souls sought release at that exact same moment, they became entwined in one another, and the neither Heaven nor Hell would grant them access. Forced back to Newerth the found themselves alive once again, but just as their souls had intertwined, so had their bodies. With the Justicar in charge in the day and the Assassin at night, they will forever be in conflict, Dual selves locked in an eternal Duel.

* Armadon

== Shop & Courier Changes ==

- Intelligent Item Combining added
* When you buy a recipe item via right-clicking on it or the "purchase remaining components" button, it will now intelligently combine as it's being purchased
* Example: Your inventory has 5 Minor Totems and Marchers. You right click on Ghost Marchers and now have Ghost Marchers in your inventory. Before, you would still have Marchers in your inventory and now have 2 Punchdagger in your stash

* When you buy a Frostwolf Skull or Geometer's Bane via right-clicking on it or the "purchase remaining components" button and have a Frostburn, it won't buy the Icebrand/Firebrand anymore
* This was done because Frostburn can be disassembled and the Icebrand/Firebrand modifiers do not stack

- Items now combine across both your inventory and stash
* When you buy a recipe item via right-clicking on it or the "purchase remaining components" button, it will now look for recipe combinations in both your inventory and stash (if you have access to it)
* Example: Your inventory has 5 Minor Totems and Marchers with one Punchdagger in your stash. You right click on Ghost Marchers and now have Ghost Marchers in your inventory. Before, you would still have Marchers in your inventory and 2 Punchdaggers in your stash

- Courier Item Combining improved significantly
* When a courier delivers items, it now intelligently combines them as they're being delivered
* Example: Your inventory has 5 Minor Totems and Marchers. The courier delivers you 2 Punchdaggers and you now have Ghost Marchers in your inventory. Before, you would still have Marchers in your inventory and the courier would still have the 2 Punchdaggers

- Item sellback enabled for newly purchased recipe items
* When a recipe item combines, it inherits the oldest purchase time of its components, so that you can still sell it for full value after combining. As with other items, the "recently purchased" flag goes away if the owner dies or if the item is used
* Example: If you buy Ghost Marchers all at once, you can sell it back in full for 15 seconds
* Example: If you have Marchers in your inventory for 30 seconds, then upgrade to Ghost Marchers, you cannot sell it back for full since the Marchers are the oldest component and they passed the 15 second window

== New Map & Mode: Mid Wars ==

* Memory usage has been dramatically reduced to help alleviate hardware limitations for players both new and old
* All Mods should be disabled once the game has been patched, as they will not reflect optimizations made to the client and will need to be updated

- The UI should now remember the match fidelity slider setting selected when creating a group and entering the queue
- Greatly improved how the game client re-connects to game servers
* Players should no longer have to type "Reconnect" on the console or re-login manually as the client will automatically try to reconnect to the game server.  Players can still reconnect by re-logging or typing reconnect, but they will no longer have to do this, they can simply wait for the reconnect dialogue to display

- Gold gained from creeps and neutrals now normalizes over time
* An example: Two heroes farm a lane for 20 minutes getting equal creep kills. Before, their gold values would have differed greatly. Now, they will have nearly equal amounts of gold.

Version 2.5.0
------------
** With today's patch we want to clarify some confusion regarding why the highly anticipated version 3.0 of HoN appears to be missing in action. With the quality of the game at stake during the later stages of development for 3.0, we realized that all the features we had originally planned for 3.0 wouldn't actually be ready for release until well into next year.

Rather than compromising our standards of quality and releasing a lackluster version 3.0 or delaying the patch into oblivion, we decided that we needed to stop holding back all this great content and bring version 2.5 to life. We hold ourselves to a higher standard come hell or high water and we know that the HoN community will support our decision.

There are a plethora of great things coming out today in version 2.5 that we stand behind in bringing the best gaming experience possible and we thank you for your patience and commitment. Without further ado, we hope you enjoy 2.5. Game HoN!

** These notes includes the notes from 2.3.5 earlier today

* Introduced a "Provisional Ranking Period" for new players that will facilitate adjusting them to their true skill level (whether higher or lower) much faster than before
* Players with team members who have been terminated should lose less points for a loss, and gain more points for a win
* Made numerous changes to the way MMR is calculated such as how many points players gain or lose each match, how match predictions are calculated between two potential teams when searching for a matchup, and many other changes to the backend calculations that should make the MMR progression much more accurate in predicting and placing a player at their true MMR rating
* Optimizations to the matchmaking algorithm that should reduce queue times across the board
* The game lobby and hero select screens now show match gain/loss values with more precision as it is now possible to gain/lose fractional amounts of MMR
* All players will have their Normal and Casual MMR compressed towards 1500. Take for example a player with Normal MMR of 1700, and Casual MMR of 1600. After the compression their Normal MMR would become become (1700 + 1500) / 2 = 1600) while their Casual MMR would become (1600 + 1500) / 2 = 1550
* The minimum MMR has been increased from 750 to 1000

== Team Matchmaking ==

- Find matches faster! Boasting arranged-team or solo play, this innovative and intuitive feature increases the efficiency of game creation by automatically gathering player statistics from a variety of group sizes, formulating teams, then matching those teams in as fair a manner as possible. With the ability to customize game mode, region, and map preferences, as well as group up with players on or off your friends list, the new Matchmaking will not only make it much faster to find a game of HoN, but also maximize the fairness and quality of the match.
- Playing Matchmaking rewards you with valuable Goblin Coins! Check out the new end-game scorescreen function after a Matchmaking game.
- Matchmaking will be disabled initially, we'll enable it when we're ready to begin public testing on it this week. Once enabled, expect it to have cycles of going up and down as we gather data, iterate, improve the algorithms, and fix any bugs.

== Cosmetic Store ==

- With goblin coin currency, which can be earned or bought, players can purchase in-game brag-worthy cosmetic upgrades. The micro-transaction based store, controlled by Merrick the goblin shopkeeper, lets players customize their experience without affecting game play or allowing the purchases to change the level of competition.

- Cosmetic upgrades include:
* Alternate hero avatars
* Taunt
* Account icons
* Alternate announcer packs
* Name color options.
* Account Symbols


== New 3v3 Map: Grimm's Crossing ==

- A new action-packed and exciting map that includes a two-way teleporter in the middle area, allowing for more innovative fighting strategies and tactics. Grimm's Crossing is a battlefield for the bloodthirsty. The terrain favors the cunning and aggressive, as hidden paths within the trees can provide a quick way to rout unsuspecting enemies. There is precious little territory to be contested over; battles are won and lost at frantic paces, often beginning and ending unexpectedly.

- Features of the new map:
* 2 lanes that are very close together
* Only one set of towers outside of each base
* Small, tightly packed map
* Neutral creeps spawn only in the middle section of the map
* No elevation at entrances into bases
* 1 rune spawn location in the center
* Towers' armor scales with number of players alive; Buildings have 100% of armor when all are alive, scaling to 0 armor when your entire team is dead. This is active if with both Casual and Normal mode on this map.
* Twin teleporters for quick transit and fun surprises
* It's a winter wonderland! Try the snow weather on this map!


== New Game Mode: Casual Mode ==

- This entirely new mode of play will provide new HoN players and casual gamers with a more "fun," less punishing way to learn and play HoN. Elements in Casual Mode speed up progression and increase rewards in ways that remain true to the game's core identity, delivering a version that can be embraced by new and veteran players alike.

- Changes from Normal Mode to Casual Mode are as follows
* Exp range from 1000 to 1300
* Removed gold loss on death
* Increased hero bounty
** Hero base gold bounty: from 200 to 300
** Hero gold bounty per level: from 5 to 10
* First blood bonus: from 200 to 300
* Gold bounty per streak: from 50 to 75
* Hero assist gold totals 50% of kill amount, split between all assisters
* Radius assist gold base: from 30 to 0
* Radius assist gold per level: from 5 to 0
* Respawn time per level from 4 seconds to 3 seconds
* Denies no longer deny experience
* Uphill miss chance removed
* Creeps give 1.25x of average normal mode value, no gold fluctuation
* Buildings give 1.5x of average normal mode value, no gold fluctuation
* Towers give global experience when killed, even to dead people, (by tower level): 150,200,250,300
* Tower last hit gold bounty: from 470,520,570,620 to 300,350,400,450
* Tower Team gold bounty: from 200,240,280,320 to 300,350,400,450
* The amount of experience required to reach the next level increases as the game goes on. This means that at the beginning, players level up a lot faster than in Normal Mode, but in the mid and late game they level up at about the same rate as in Normal Mode.
* Buyback costs are at 1.75x normal mode values
* Towers' armor scales with number of players alive; Buildings have 100% of armor when all are alive, scaling to 0 armor when your entire team is dead.


== New Interface Features ==

- We have revamped the in-game interface to be more dynamic, informative, and efficient.

- Enhancements include:
* Advanced mini-map interaction. Try hovering over heroes, buildings, or wards!
* Pull down tabs in the upper right for intuitive access to vote functions and game options
* Graphic kill messages for feedback when you net a kill in the upper left.
* A gold counter to see the breakdown of your gold earnings from different sources. Hover your mouse over your gold count to see the exact breakdown!
* Experience range indicators to mark enemies within the experience gain range. You will notice a small purple diamond next a creep's health bar when you are in range and a purple diamond effect will play when they die if you got experience.
* Context-sensitive pings to highlight the object and send out alert messages to allies. Try Alt+Clicking an ally, enemy, or building.
* A hover-over inventory to allow for quicker inventory feedback on allies and enemies. Hover over an enemy to quickly see their inventory.


== BETA Map Editor ==

- With the exact same tool that we used to make HoN, users can now create and edit maps for enhanced single-player experiences. Users who are inspired to create multi-player maps can submit their map designs to the HoN DREAM website for potential inclusion in HoN. Also, in conjunction with scripting manipulation, players can create their own custom modes.
- This is still a BETA version of the Map Editor, and as such still has features to be added, polish to be done, and bugs to be fixed. Keep this in mind!
- To open the editor, use the editor.bat file in your HoN directory or re-install the game and it will automatically add a shortcut to your start menu as well


== Weather Effects ==

- A storm has arrived on Newerth with HoN 2.0 and it shows! Change the weather of the map you are in at any time through the Options menu and feel free to sing in the rain.
- Players can set their preferred weather effect in the interface options or with a chat command. Right now we support "Rain" and "Snow". The default is "Off".

- Chat commands are as follows:
* /weather
* /weather None
* /weather Rain
* /weather Snow

- We included a text file with instructions on how to make your own weather effects in the HoN directory


== New Item: Spellshards ==

- It's time for the magic users of Newerth to show their true power! With Spellshards, they can pierce the defenses of the enemy and burn them to a crisp that much faster.
- The wielder's spells ignore a portion of their enemy's magic armor, causing increased magic damage.
- After obtaining this item, the recipe may be re-purchased to upgrade it. Can be upgraded two additional times.
- Components: Great Arcana (1675) + Recipe (1000)

- Stats:
* 6 Intelligence
* 17 Damage
* 10 Attack Speed

Matchmaking 2.0

- Matchmaking has received some serious revisions that should drastically improve match making quality. Please help us further perfect our match making system by giving it a try and leaving feedback on the forums
* Reworked how matches are formed to more consistently replace players who fail to load and to decrease time to find matches for players with exceptionally high or low SMR ratings
* Players new to matchmaking must complete 5 provisional matches, in which they will be matched with other new players. If not enough new players are available, they will eventually be matched with regular players. 
* Players new to matchmaking have the option to set their initial SMR according to general skill level. The three options are Beginner (1300), Intermediate (1500), and advanced (1700).
* Solo matchmaking now uses Banning Draft instead of Banning Pick


Ingame Changes

- Added a new keybinding: Direct Pathing
* When held down and an order is given (Move, Attack, Cast, etc) will move the hero in a direct path towards where you click no matter what is in the way. Ignores cliffs, heroes, and creeps. Useful for chasing through the woods or pushing yourself against a cliff to cast into the river!
- Re-arranged some of the shop to put modifers into the correct (bottom) shop. This includes all lifesteal items. Brutalizer and Lightning items are now in the Combat shop. Be wary of your hotkeys!
- If you buy an item on a courier then transfer that item to your hero, you can now sell that item for its full value within the 15sec sellback period
- Added game option "Minimap Rightclick" (default on). When disabled, the player cannot rightclick on the minimap.
- The game will no longer display an incorrect disconnect message indicating that the hero was removed and assets distributed to their team if the disconnected player was a referee or spectator
- Fixed disconnect messages appearing twice when a player disconnects in game
- Calling a vote to remake, pause or kick (through the console) before the pre-match game phase will no longer work. (ie. only after the players are loaded into the map can they call these.)
- If displaying chat timestamps were enabled in game, various game messages sent to both teams were not being timestamped (disconnects, Kongor kills, Barracks destruction, etc). These messages now display the timestamp properly if the client has this option enabled.
- New death for the legion main building
- Finally took down our Christmas lights...

Pre-Game Changes

- Hero icons no-longer react to mouseovers/clicks when there's no hero
- The loading race values now start at 1 and end at 10, the old race values should no longer appear when loading the next game
- Pressing ALT in the game lobby will now toggle the chat mode between "Team" and "All" chat modes.
- Moved the Ping/Players/Version labels in the game lobby a bit to the right as we weren't making use of the space and server names with long names like those we use for South Africa overlapped into these labels
- Voice chat indicator/mute button shows up in the hero picker/etc. now (on the inner side of the hero name)

General Changes

- Replays now begin recording during the picking phase
- Removed the "Tier" filters, columns and inputs from the game browser and create game interface
- Added filters, sortable columns and all inputs for Min/Max PSR to the game browser and create game interface
* Players may now specify a Min/Max PSR range when creating a game. Min/Max PSR games will appear normally as they would in the game browser and other players may join a game if their PSR falls within 2% of the range the game server Min/Max PSR is set to. (This means a player with 1471 PSR should be able to make it into a game marked Min 1500, and a 1734 player would be able to join a game marked as Max 1700, but those are the very edge of the 2% tolerance, so anything higher or lower would be rejected.)
- Games outside of a player's PSR range are grayed out in the game browser similar to the way "No Leaver" games appear to a player with leaver status. If no range is specified when the game is created then no range is enforced. If a player is invited to a game, the server ignores the PSR restrictions for them allowing friends to play in games they may not normally be able to be playing
- Added Min/Max PSR to the /gi or /gameinfo commands
- The players PSR is now retrieved stored locally on the client when logging in, and is accessible through the UI_CMD() GetPSR()
- Removed the ticks, grinds, and blips and whatnot that were playing when the game started up
- Added an option "Disable Background Effects" that allows users to toggle whether or not all the background lobby effects and animations are played. (Credit to Pancakeslp for the original mod)
- Fixed some buddy request/add notifications playing sounds a bunch of times when logging in if a player had those notifications saved in their history
- The Notification Duration slider under options->interface now sets the duration (1-15 seconds) a notification is displayed for
- Fixed a number of incorrectly labeled tooltips on the options menu. Disabled the "Health/Mana Bar Scale" in the options
- Removed the "Options" menu from the F10 in game menu
- Fixed "Add PlayerName" buttons on options menu to align properly and correctly add the player clicked on
- Increased max size of joinable channels to 30
- Using the slash command /join <channelname> "password" will now attempt to join the channel with the password specified. (Anything in between the quotes at the end becomes the password)
- Fixed some issues in the client/interface causing the change password dialogue to not work
- Fixed the lock/unlocked tooltip for hosts to display the correct tip (was previously showing the opposite tooltip it should have been showing)
- Players can now select Logon/Logoff and Join/Leave Game notification settings for clan members separately from the notifications they select for their friends
- Fixed an issue where notifications were not being saved to the history properly
- Fixed the default notification time to be 10 seconds instead of 10000
- Updated sub-account description
- Removed "Show Menu Transitions" from the options menu as the option is not currently being used

- Fixed "/r" to not reply to a clan whisper automatically with "/c m", instead it will reply directly to the sender with a "/w PlayerName" just like how "/b m" works
- Trying out new color for the selected item in listboxes
- Fixed the "Show Winner" button on the match stats screen to correctly display and announce the team who won
- Fixed sound driver list sometimes showing the current driver incorrectly
* This means the sound system will only restart if it is indeed necessary
- Fixed a couple places where linux system class was using incorrect character conversions
- Added console command "precacheworld <mapname>". So for example type "precacheworld caldavar" to precache its resources
- Removed cvar browser_maxPing as it was not being used
- Invisible Mode will now remember its state the next time the game re-loads
- Players in "Invisible Mode" will no longer auto join default HoN or Clan channels when leaving a game, allowing them to properly remain in a hidden state
- Clicking on the clock in the system bar now toggles between 12 hour and 24 hour display
- Re-arranged Public and Create Game interfaces to make more space and added icons/checkboxes for the new "Hardcore" and  "Dev Heroes" game options
- Moved "Alt Hero Picking" on the Create Game interface to an Advanced Option, which is what it is actually categorized as

- New Front End Interface
- Solo Automatic Matchmaking
* With one button you can enter the queue for as many different regions as you want and play with random other people automatically. This does not use PSR, it uses SMR (Solo Matchmaking Rating) and everyone starts at 1500. Mode is Banning Pick.
* Players tagged as "leavers" can not join Matchmaking
* Players who leave a game before it starts (during the 'loading' phase of a game) will automatically be replaced by someone else.
* If you leave a Matchmaking game at the hero selection screen, you will get a leave
- Tutorial
* New ingame interactive Tutorial to help new players learn the basics of the game before diving in. Even experienced players might learn something!
- New Player Stats screen
* Including your most played heroes!
- Hero Compendium
* See detailed stats and recommended items about every hero
- Ingame Ladder page
* Search and filter the ladder to compare yourself to those at the top. Any number of options can be turned on and filtered!
- New Game Lobby
- New Hero Picking screen
* Now with 12 more slots for new heroes! How did we do that?!?


General

- You can now swap the placement of the minimap from the bottom left to bottom right hand corner
- Leaver threshold lowered to 5%
- Fix for StatusStealth
* This fixed an issue that was causing Witch Slayer and Pollywog Priest's crowd control abilities to dispel all states off the target
- Updated br stringtables, thanks to Trilles
- Recommended Items Updated
- Item cursor now changes to a targeting cursor when hovering over an allied unit
- Stacked items (runes of blight, mana potions, health potions) will now sell for their full total value within 15 seconds of purchasing them. (e.g. if you buy two health potions for 200g then sell them within 15sec, you will now correctly gain 200g)
- Logger's Hatchet can now be sold within 15 seconds of buying it (but not if you used it)
- Added "Host:" and "Version:" to the /gameinfo and /gi commands in game, also added the server version for display in the game lobby screen
- Fixed when heroes were 'running in place' after using a Homecoming Stone
- Added messages to the game lobby for the following actions:
1) When the host assigns someone as the new host
2) When the host assigns someone as a spectator
3) When the host assigns someone as a referee
4) When the host locks or unlocks a slot
- Removed 'remove hero' button in practice mode for now
- Tweaked the position of ancients

- Invisible Mode added
- Fixed a bug in the game setup interface where referee count was incorrectly being set to the count of spectators chosen
- Fixed a bug in the game lobby where the current player count exceeded the max player count in games with spectators(2) and referees(1). e.g. "Players: 13/10". Now shows the correct max player count to match the main lobby game browser numbers. e.g. "Players: 13/13"
- Added flood protection to the chat server to protect against invite to clan spam and create clan attempts
- Fixed an issue causing the change password functionality in game to not work correctly.
- Fixed an issue on the chat server where in certain cases players were not properly being promoted/demoted
- Optimized client code so game server refreshes should no longer hang the client or user interface.
- Chat channels can now be saved via the interface and will be automatically joined when logging in.
- Added new "Ping" filter next to the "Full Games" checkbox. It filters the results on the client so only pings less the chosen number populate the game list
- Added a new filter option to the server browser "Game Mode:" section called "Advanced". It allows players to filter multiple game modes (ie. SD, BD, BP) all at once locally in the client. Upon selecting 'Advanced' a small panel pops up and the player can choose the game modes they want to see in the game list just by selecting the appropriate checkbox then clicking OK
- Default SFX volume down to 0.6 from 0.7
- Fixed an issue with the chat server where if a user sent a message using /b or /m and someone on one of those lists was in /dnd mode, it wouldn't send the message to all the people on the list.
- Overhauled how adding buddies/friends works. You now must request friendship before someone is actually added as your friend.
* You can request friends when offline and they will get the notifications upon logging in, and approve at their convenience
* We might have to wipe current friends lists at some point in the future for this to work correctly.

- Added new search support for filtering games by name:
* Added feature to allow players to type in multiple search phrases. By typing a search phrase and adding a ?|? the client will distinguish one phrase from another. The browser will then search the available games and show any games showing any one of the phrases separated by a "|".
* Added feature to allow players to exclude certain games based on the search phrase. By typing in a "-" at the beginning of the search phrase the client will automatically filter any games with "Phrase" to not show up. Note that exclusion of search terms takes precedence over inclusion. (Excluding a term, and then trying to include the same term will cause it not to appear, ie ?noobs|-noobs?)
* The "|" and "-" can be escaped with a "\" should the player want to search on a game with the pipe or hyphen in it.
* All searches are color and case insensitive, and the order that the search phrases are entered have no effect on how they will display. So "1500|-no ab" is the same as "-no ab|1500".

Some examples:
*Search Phrase: "1550|1600|1650|-no ab|-noobs" - This searches on any game with "1550", "1600", and "1650" in the name, and if it has the words "no ab" or "noobs" in it it will not display.
*Search Phrase: "-no ab|1500|1550|-countryname|ab" - This searches on any game with "1500", "1550" and "ab" in the name, and if it has the words "no ab" or "countryname" in it it will not display.
*Search Phrase: "1500|\-SDEM|pipe\|test" - This searches on any game with "1500", "-sdem" and "pipe|test" in the name.

Version 0.1.65
--------------
General

- Significant Lane Creep AI changes
* These all involve the assist trigger that causes the creeps to aggro you when you attack an enemy hero:
1. When a hero causes the assist trigger to go off, there is a 200ms delay before the creeps will turn and come at you
2. Creeps will chase for exactly 1600ms (down from 1800ms)
3. If a creep is in the middle of an attack animation but has not hit its attack impact point (600ms), it will deagro and stop its attack as long as you are out of it's short melee range
* AKA: Creeps will not finish attacks they start on you if they hit the end of the trigger
4. A creep must deal damage before it can be called by the assist trigger again
* This means if you tug, they must turn around and actually deal damage to a unit before it can chase again
5. You must be within 600 units of an enemy hero to cause the assist trigger to go off

New hero: Magmus, based off DOTA hero Sand King
The primordial and elemental creature known as Magmus is no demon, though he fights alongside the Hellbourne.  Rather, he was drawn forth from the earth, as evil calls to evil and separate flames join to form an inferno.  A holdover from an ancient, cataclysmic age of fire, Magmus dreams of returning Newerth to ash, lava, and cinder, and he wields his considerable might and magic in that terrible cause.
- Ability 1 - Lava Surge 
* Riding on lava, Magmus surges toward a target location, damaging and stunning enemy units in his path.
- Ability 2 - Steam Bath 
* Magmus releases extreme heat, toasting the area around him. The resulting steam damages nearby enemy units over time and cloaks Magmus from enemy eyes.
- Ability 3 - Volcanic Touch
* Upon attacking enemy units, Magmus' flaming mace instills an intense heat in them. If they die while under the effects of this intense heat, they explode, damaging the nearby enemies of Magmus.
- Ability 4 - Eruption
* Magmus channels the power of the lava, releasing it after a short delay. The resulting lava grows over time, damaging nearby enemies over several seconds.

================
= New Features =
================

Pub Skill Rating
- Pub Skill Rating is a rough estimation of player skill level from public (non-ranked) games. It is an ELO based value that accounts for who you are winning and losing to. Note that it will take 20 games for your PSR to become valid, and before then it won't be displayed.
- Included with the PSR system is a team balance feature for game hosts to use, which will attempt to balance the game based on the players' PSR.

* It should be noted that this map has received limited internal testing and tweaking. With that in mind, please report any and all issues you find on the forum

New Hero: Valkyrie, based off DOTA hero Priestess of the Moon
- The ancient sagas of the heathen north have long told to the tale of the battle-women known as Valkyries.  For centuries, their ranks have thinned as the old ways have died out and civilization stretched its smothering hand over the frozen wilds.  But some Valkyries still remain, cold and swift as the north wind, wielding their lances with expertise to rival the most veteran Legion warriors.
- Ability 1: Call of the Valkyrie
* Valkyrie calls forth several Battle Maidens to damage nearby enemies. 
- Ability 2: Javelin of Light
* Valkyrie hurls a Javelin of Light toward a target location. The first enemy hit will be damaged and stunned. Stun duration depends on the distance the Javelin has traveled.
