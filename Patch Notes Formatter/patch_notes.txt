== Staff of the Master & Master's Legacy Changes ==



+ This patch will be the first in a series of multiple patches that will focus on rebalancing Staff of the Master effects across different heroes, as well as focus on making this item's effects "worth it" for heroes that don't normally pick up the item (e.g. carry heroes), but can obtain the effect from an ally's Master's Legacy.

+ Additionally, some of the staler Staff of the Master effects will be revamped, and some new & exciting Staff of the Master effects will be added to the game!

+ To ensure that the power of all of these effects are properly gated, the price of Master's Legacy has to increase by a substantial amount.
