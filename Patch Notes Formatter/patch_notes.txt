- Players can now vote for themselves (for the time being, anyway).



== Design ==



= Hero Balance =

Aluna

Emerald Lightning
- Attack Speed buff on Aluna now has a max charge count of 3.
- Staff of the Master changes (to pre-existing):
*Bounce count increased from 2 to 3 (i.e. max potential units affected increased from 3 to 4) while boosted by Emerald Red.

_______________________________________________

Hammer Throw
- Staff of the Master effect changes (to pre-existing):
*Hammer projectile speed reduced from 3000 to 1800 units per second.

_______________________________________________

Hellbringer

Summon Malphas
- Malphas Max Health reduced from 1000/1500/2000 to 900/1400/1900.
- Malphas Attack Damage reduced from 80/130/180 to 80/125/170.
- Malphas' Destruction passive ability: bonus damage dealt to structures reduced from 50/75/100% to 30/40/50%.

_______________________________________________

Keeper of the Forest

Nature's Guidance
- Can now target ally structures to apply the Armor and Health Regeneration state (but not the stealth state).
*Any damage a structure takes while the Backdoor Protection System is in effect & the appropriate conditions are fulfilled will not trigger the system if the structure's current health is greater than the "checkpoint" health value saved by the Backdoor Protection System.
*Example: After a regular push (under non-backdoor conditions), a tower's Health drops from 1900 (max Health) to 1500 (this is the checkpoint health value). The If Nature's Guidance heals the Tower's Health above 1500 and an enemy attempts to backdoor & fulfills the system's conditions, then the Backdoor Protection System will not grant 20 Health Regeneration per second to the tower until it is below the checkpoint health value (1500). This bonus regeneration will only occur until it reaches the checkpoint value again - Nature's Guidance's regeneration will continue to take place throughout these events as intended.
