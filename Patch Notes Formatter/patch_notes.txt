== Design ==



= Hero Rework - Nitro =



Nitro (Reworked)

+ Nitro's fire-while-moving mechanic as a primary mechanic is conceptually broken/imbalanced and frustrating to deal with in this game. This concept simply does not work in HoN in a fair manner.
+ This results in making her high-highs too distinct from the other levels of performance, and also drastically punishes the average player who plays her while disproportionately rewarding veteran Nitro players.
+ Additionally, she was statistically impossible to balance, both in terms of power, performance and frustration levels.
+ The rework maintains her hit-and-run mechanic and makes her kit much more fun overall, but allows both the Nitro player and other players in the game to interact with her more fairly.
+ She even gets to keep a fun & balanced version of her fire-while-moving mechanic on her ultimate as a nice bonus!



- Now has default auto-attack behaviour.

- Cooldown increased from 40 seconds to 70 seconds.

_______________________________________________



= User Interface =

- Account Icon is now approximately 50% larger in a user's statistics page and no longer has an unnecessary border around it (new User Interface).



= Music =

- Lobby soundtrack has been updated to the Arcadian theme.
- Main (out-of-game) soundtrack has been updated to the Apollo theme.



= General =

Ranked Pick
- Now has a 5 second delay when transitioning from the hero banning phase to the first hero pick of the game.
- Max number of hero bans that can take place at the end of the banning phase increased from 4 to 6.



= Neutrals =

Fire Ogre
- Max Mana increased from 0 to 200.
- Now has an active ability: Immolating Flames
*Mana Cost: 100
*Cooldown: 30 seconds
*Range: 800
*Target an ally unit to apply Immolating Flames to it for 30 seconds. Immolating Flames deals 20 Magic Damage per second in a 200 radius around the affected target.
*Fire Ogre will not use this ability if it is not under a player's control.



= Runes =

New Rune: Merrick's Rune
- Replaces Refreshment Rune in the game.
- Restores 135 Health and 80 Mana over 3 seconds and is dispelled on damage (same as a single Bottle use).
- Grants 35 Gold, plus 2 Gold per minute of elapsed game time (excluding the pregame time).
- When bottled, it refills your Bottle to full (3/3), behaving the same as a regular rune.
*Previously filled to 2/3 when it was Refreshment Rune.
- If targeted via Ioyn Stone, the rune will be consumed and gives Ioyn Stone 2 charges (the same as before with Refreshment Rune).
*Gives the user of Ioyn Stone the gold benefits of the rune immediately when this occurs. The gold benefits do not transfer to the Ioyn Stone charges.

+ Merrick's Rune is intended to replace Refreshment Rune. It solves the feeling of utter disappointment, as the player who gets Merrick's Rune will have much more of a compensation if they do not end up obtaining the primary rune that spawns.



= Mid Wars =

- Snotter Boss has returned to Newerth to replace Transmutanstein & Zorgath (for now)!
- Merrick's Rune now spawns at the top of the river and floats down towards the boss lair.
* This occurs every 30 seconds after creeps spawn, starting from 0:15.
- MMR for Mid Wars: only your own MMR is now visible in the hero pick lobby.

+ Mid Wars is not a game mode where we want players to feel like they are under pressure and/or judge others based on their MMR. We simply want them to have fun & enjoy the game!
+ For the players who use their Mid Wars MMR as a measure of personal progression, your own MMR is still visible only to yourself.

Static Shock
- Number of autoattacks required to proc reduced from 3 to 2.
- Max number of side targets affected by Static Shock reduced from 3 to 1.
*Total max number of targets affected by Static Shock reduced from 4 to 2.

+ Making Static Shock proc more frequently should be an overall improvement to Power Overwhelming's charge buildup rate without it getting too out of hand.

_______________________________________________

Scout

Disarm
- State duration reduced from 2.5 seconds to 2 seconds.

_______________________________________________

Shadowblade

Gargantuan's Blast
- Mana Cost changed from 90 to 75/85/95/105.
- Magic Damage reduced from 60/120/180/240 to 55/110/165/220.
- Now suffers a 20% Damage Penalty and -15% Movement Speed while this form is active.

Feint's Siphon
- Mana Cost changed from 90 to 75/85/95/105.
- Magic Damage reduced from 60/120/180/240 to 55/110/165/220.
- Now receives an additional 8% Damage while this form is active.

+ Shadowblade's kit has a little too much early game power and survivability in high level play, making his snowball a little too difficult to deal with.

+ Additionally, the Gargantuan Form is still overly strong compared to the other forms, as maintaining the benefits of the base form while also having such a good early game survivability tool that scales well into the game was a bit much. The intention of the Gargantuan Form is durability first & foremost, and not to grant Shadowblade high damage upkeep while doing so.

+ Feint Form was also a little bit too good against enemy carries. In general, Gargantuan Form and Feint Form now have small downsides to them so the player thinks a little bit more about their form shifting usage.

_______________________________________________



= Items =

 

New Item: Spyglass
- Given to all players at the start of the game.
- Activate to bring up the targeting cursor.
*Using Spyglass will transform it into harmless confetti at the target location.
*Sells for 0 Gold (can be sold though).
*Cannot be dropped.
*Expires after 90 seconds.

+ This item solely exists for the select few players who are experiencing the AoE indicator lag, as there has not been a common factor among the tiny fraction of players that experience this issue & nobody has been able to pinpoint what causes this issue.
+ Previously known as one of the most useless items in HoN's history, Spyglass makes its way back into Newerth and finally becomes useful to a small subset of players!

_______________________________________________

Jade Spire
- Bonus Max Mana reduced from 400 to 300.
- Bonus Mana Regeneration reduced from 150% to 115%.
- Mid Wars only change: bonus Range granted to abilities increased from 100 to 150.

+ Jade Spire was giving way too much additional benefits upon completion for only 600 Gold. Toning down these benefits makes the item more in line with the benefits other items receive upon their completion.

_______________________________________________

Orb of Zamos
- New recipe: Minor Totem (50) + Recipe (250) = 300 Gold Total (Total Cost unchanged from before)
- Bonus Strength, Agility and Intelligence reduced from 2 to 1.
- Gold bonus for creep kills is now halved if the distance between the linked heroes is greater than 1500.

Grave Locket
- Now requires a 25 Gold Recipe.
*Total Cost increased from 775 Gold to 800 Gold.
- Bonus Agility reduced from 5 to 2.
- Gold bonus for creep kills is now halved if the distance between the linked heroes is greater than 1500.
- Bonus Experience granted to the linked hero per enemy creep kill reduced from 15 to 10.
- Now only grants Bonus Experience to the linked hero for an enemy creep kill if the linked hero is not within the experience range of the creep kill.

+ These changes should help reduce the performance gap between solo laners in the unsafe lane ("suicide lane heroes") and the support hero of a dual lane.

+ Furthermore, both of these items were a little too efficient. They should now be considered less of a "must-buy" item as a laning support.

+ In particular, Grave Locket was literally generating free experience if both laning heroes are in lane and killing creeps. This issue has been remedied with this change.

_______________________________________________

Refreshing Ornament
- New recipe: Trinket of Restoration (350) + Minor Totem (50) + Recipe (150) = 550 Gold Total
- Bonus Agility reduced from 5 to 2.

Astrolabe
- Bonus Agility reduced from 8 to 5.
- Recipe cost increased from 400 to 510.
*Total cost increased from 1440 to 1550.

+ Agility carry heroes who picked up Refreshing Ornament for an efficient laning item that also granted them Agility, while upgrading the item into Astrolabe as an extremely cost-efficient survivability item that also granted them Agility was way too powerful.

+ Changing the components closer to how they were in the past should remedy this issue by quite a bit. Astrolabe was also too cost-efficient for what it did, so a slight cost nerf is also warranted.

_______________________________________________

Barrier Idol
- State duration increased from 8 seconds to 10 seconds.
- State duration is now doubled for non-hero units.

Nome's Wisdom
- Bonus Magic Armor from the aura increased from 2 to 3.
- Component priority changed from "Mystic Vestments -> Ring of the Teacher -> Manatube -> Recipe" to "Ring of the Teacher -> Manatube -> Mystic Vestments -> Recipe".

+ Magic Armor items for pushing and teamfights were a little lacking. These changes give them a little bit more utility and flexibility for their intended function.

_______________________________________________

Spellshards (Reworked)
- Component Buildup: Perpetual Cogwheel (1325) + Recipe (825) = 2150 Gold Total.
- Can be upgraded up to 2 times (max of 3 total levels).
*Total Gold Cost is therefore 2150/2975/3800 Gold.
- Passively grants 150/175/200% Mana Regeneration and 5/10/15 Intelligence.
- Passively grants +10/15/20% Spell Damage against non-hero units.
- Passively grants 30/45/60% Magic Armor Penetration.

+ This rework to Spellshards makes it less universally amazing for all heroes, while also properly gating its power behind a reasonable price point.
_______________________________________________

Ringmail
- Armor reduced from 5 to 4.
- Cost reduced from 550 to 450.

Lex Talionis
- Recipe Cost increased from 100 Gold to 200 Gold.
*Total Cost remains unchanged from before (1150 Gold).
- Bonus Armor reduced from 6 to 5.
- Armor addition/reduction when applied to an ally/enemy reduced from 6 to 5, respectively.
*Armor reduction on self when this occurs is also reduced from 6 to 5.

Sol's Bulwark
- Recipe Cost increased from 1000 Gold to 1050 Gold.
*Total Cost reduced from 1550 Gold to 1500 Gold 
*This is due to the reduction of cost in Ringmail.

Daemonic Breastplate
- Total Cost reduced from 5250 Gold to 5200 Gold.
*This is due to the reduction of cost from both Ringmail and Sol's Bulwark.

Ultor's Heavy Helm
- Recipe cost increased from 1000 Gold to 1025 Gold.
- Total cost reduced from 3725 Gold to 3650 Gold.
*This is due to the reduction of cost from Ringmail.

Shield of the Five
- Recipe Cost increased from 200 Gold to 300 Gold.
*Total Cost remains unchanged from before (800 Gold).
- Passive effect changes: Armor reduced from 5 to 4.
- Active effect changes:
*Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
*Duration reduced from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.
*Effects are no longer doubled for the first 10 seconds of the state duration.
*Armor granted to ally units and structures reduced from 2 to 1.

Plated Greaves
- Passive effect changes: Armor reduced from 7 to 6.
- Active effect changes:
*Cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
*Duration reduced from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.
*Effects are no longer doubled for the first 10 seconds of the state duration.
*Armor granted to allied heroes and structures reduced from 2 to 1.5.
*Ally non-hero units now also receive the Armor bonus.

+ These Armor items were a little too efficient early on, and Plated Greaves and Shield of the Five did a little too much as well. These adjustments should put them more in line with the game's general power level.

_______________________________________________

Hypercrown
- Recipe Cost increased from 700 Gold to 800 Gold.
*Total Cost increased from 5500 Gold to 5600 Gold.

Icon of the Goddess
- Mid Wars only changes:
*Gift of the Goddess state: Healing per second reduced from 15 to 7.5.
*Gift of the Goddess state: Mana Regeneration per second reduced from 20 to 10.
*Max charges reduced from 25 to 15.

Twin Blades
- Bonus Mana Regeneration reduced from 75% to 50%.
- Damage on the secondary attack reduced from 100% to 80%.

_______________________________________________

Ward of Revelation
- Initial placement that gives vision of enemy Wards in fog: radius of this mechanic reduced from 800 to 400.
*The default reveal radius of 800 remains untouched.

+ Counterwarding is a pretty one-dimensional choice when placing them: simply cover the most area possible.

+ By reducing the radius of the intiial placement that gives vision of existing enemy Wards that are in fog, players now have to choose more carefully between optimal area coverage of possible enemy ward locations, or getting suboptimal coverage while revealing ward on high ground.

+ Players can still technically gain the both these benefits if they have a hero that can grant temporary clearvision of wards, or if they purchase the Flying Courier from the item shop.
