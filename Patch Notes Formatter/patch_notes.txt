== Forests of Caldavar ("New") ==

The main goal of the changes to the "new" Forests of Caldavar map is to make the viability of each laning setup choice to be more on par with one another, while retaining their own unique benefits and disadvantages.

- Legion bottom lane and Hellbourne top lane trees were rearranged significantly.
- Legion's southeastern most pull camp: a tree to the left of the camp (and to the right of the Observatory) has been removed to allow heroes to move through the nearby path.

+ There were far too many spots near the lane that made it nearly impossible to find a hero unless you were right next to the hero (and even then, sometimes it was nearly impossible to do so)., which led to unhealthy play patterns by solo unsafe lane heroes.
+ These changes address that issue, while still allowing for some niche hiding spots to be discovered. While this may appear to be a nerf to solo unsafe lane heroes, the jungle changes will more than compensate for that.



= Jungle Changes =

Hellbourne bottom lane - Medium pull camp (unsafe lane)
- Camp is now more accessible to the unsafe lane to be pulled into the lane
- Trees in this area now allow for better vision from the unsafe lane, while the vision of that camp ends up being more obscured for the safe lane
- Also reworked tree patch in this area to more closely mirror the Hellbourne side of the map.

Legion Ancients camp
- Now spawns a Hard neutral camp instead of an Ancients neutral camp.
- The other central Hard neutral camp has been replaced with a Medium neutral camp.
- A few trees have been removed to allow for more visibility & to allow for a slightly easier double stack.

Legion left-most Medium & Hard neutral camps
- Camps were shifted slightly towards the bottom-right.
- Leash range of these camps have been reverted to normal.
- Path between both camps are now more cleared of obstructions.
- Distance between both camps are now more similar to the Hellbourne equivalent (top-right-most) camps.
*These changes prevent the camps from being pulled towards the Legion middle lane, while simultaneously solving the difficulties of being difficult to double-stack these camps (due to a prior temporary fix).

Legion top lane - Medium pull camp (unsafe lane)
- Camp is now more accessible to the unsafe lane to be pulled into the lane.
- Trees in this area now allow for better vision from the unsafe lane, while the vision of that camp ends up being more obscured for the safe lane.

Hellbourne Ancients camp
- Now spawns a Hard neutral camp instead of an Ancients neutral camp.
- The other central Hard neutral camp has been replaced with a Medium neutral camp.
*This camp has also been rotated to face the new Hard camp more directly.

Hellbourne top-right-most Hard camp
- This neutral camp was shifted slightly downward.
- Leash range of the camp has been reverted to normal.
- This prevents the camps from being pulled towards the Hellbourne top lane.



+ Most of these jungle changes were done to balance the jungles between the Legion side and Hellbourne side, as well as make the top and bottom lanes slightly more equal in terms of the safe and unsafe lanes.

+ Overall, these changes (coupled with other changes in previous patches like the Merrick's Rune change) should make laning setup choices more balanced with regards to one another (any permutation/combination of 2-1-2 vs. 1-1-2-jungle and other dynamic variants involving partial/full roamers).

_______________________________________________



= Neutral Creep Changes =

Dragon
- Gold Bounty: 28-36 -> 35-45
- Physical Armor: 2-> 3
- Attack Damage: 55-> 60

Dragon Master
- Gold Bounty: 100-120 -> 130-145
- Magic Armor: 12 -> 10

Dreadbeetle
- Gold Bounty: 44-52 -> 55-65
- Physical Armor: 3 -> 6
- Base Attack Time: 1.4 -> 1.3

Dreadbeetle Queen
- Gold Bounty:  74-82 -> 90-105
- Physical Armor: 6 -> 10
- Base Attack Time: 1.4 -> 1.3

Predasaur
- Gold Bounty: 48-56 -> 60-70
- Physical Armor: 3.5 -> 6
- Max Health: 900 -> 1000

Predasaur Crusher
- Gold Bounty: 58-66 -> 70-85



+ The previous Gold Bounty nerfs have been reverted because there will now only be 1 Ancient Camp in the "new" Forests of Caldavar map.
+ Some stat adjustments were also made to make the camps more comparable to one another in terms of power, while still retaining their unique strengths and weaknesses.

_______________________________________________



= Mid Wars Changes =

The main goal of these changes to Mid Wars is to resolve some common frustrations encountered by players in this mode, while slowly leaning towards rewarding properly applied early/mid game aggressive plays & pushes.



- Zorgath and Transmutanstein return to Mid Wars!
*Say goodbye to Snotter Boss until next time!

- Matchmaking constraints for Mid Wars are slightly less relaxed, which should result in increasing the chances of getting a more enjoyable match.

- Earliest concede time availability reduced from 10 minutes to 5 minutes.
*This vote still requires 5 votes from a single team to actually pass (at least until 15 minutes where the usual reduction in required votes occurs).



- Backdoor Protection is now applied to the Melee and Ranged Barracks as well, and grants the Barracks 50% Damage Reduction against non-hero units while active (Main Base structure has 50% Damage Reduction against non-hero units by default already).
*Additionally, the Backdoor Protection state on the Main Base Structure and Barracks now also grants 50% Damage Reduction against heroes.

+ This change should help slow down uncoordinated & uncommitted attempts to end the game by backdooring to the point where the defending team can react and take action before the Main Base Structure falls.
+ The intention is not to remove backdooring (as it has its place to end the game when there are long stalemates for long periods of time), but to make it more of a committal and coordinated strategy to execute & introduce more opportunities to counterplay it. We understand that games ended abruptly without much means for counterplay makes for an anti-climatic ending, but having backdooring as an alternate game-ending option for long games is still necessary if the circumstances make it viable.



- Main Base Structure's Health Regeneration per second reduced from 50 to 20 (when not damaged by an enemy within the last 10 seconds).

+ This change partially addresses the frustration of getting the base to a low Health value, only to see it regenerate to full Health too quickly.


- Neutral camp composition has been changed (no longer spawns traditional the Hard neutral camps).
- Instead, now spawns 1 of the following camps:
*Dragon Master, Skeleton King, Vagabond Leader, Ice Ogre
*Predasaur Crusher, Vulture Lord, Minotaur, Wolf Commander
*Dreadbeetle Queen, Catman Champion, Vulture Lord, Wild Hunter

+ This change provides minimal disruption to the current map, while making the Gold & Experience value of the neutral camp more suitable for the mid & late game (rather than something that can be tackled in the early game by 1-2 heroes) and simultaneously discourages raw jungling early on (to keep the spirit of the map's name - Mid Wars).
+ Furthermore, this change allows Ophelia and Parasite to make use of Ancient Creeps if they have Staff of the Master.
+ This also allows these heroes more variety of creeps they can take control of in the early game, though the Ancient creep has to be cleared (or the camp needs to be stacked) for them to spawn more neutral creeps they can take control of in the early game.



- Respawn time equation has been changed.
*Old equation: Respawn Time (s) = 0.6 * Hero_Level
*New equation: Respawn Time (s) = (0.5 * Hero_Level) + 3.75 * (2 - Ally_Nonbase_Towers_Remaining)

+ The new respawn times allow for slightly faster early game respawns, while extending the respawn times by 3.75 seconds for each of your ally non-base towers that have been destroyed.
+ This gives pushing some tangible benefit in Mid Wars and disfavours turtling, without making early/mid game strategies too snowbally in nature.
+ Overall, this increases the respawn time at level 25 from 17 seconds (in all situations) to 12.5/16.25/20 seconds when 0/1/2 of your non-base towers are down. Further adjustments may be made in the future if this does not prove to be enough of a change.

_______________________________________________



== Design ==

- Max Disconnection Time reduced from 5 minutes to 4 minutes.
- AFK Timer duration reduced from 4 minutes to 2.5 minutes.
*AFK Warning time reduced from 3 minutes to 1.5 minutes.

+ While we understand that real-life situations & technical difficulties can happen once in a blue moon, they should not be happening frequently in any capacity.

+ Players should be active in the game for as much time as possible without disrupting the gameplay for others, and these changes help encourage players to make sure that they exhibit due diligence on their part to do so.



Fortification of Sol / Demonic Fortification
- Now goes on a 90 second cooldown when the game starts.
*Prevents players from accidentally triggering it at the start of the game while typing & transitioning from the hero pick lobby to the in-game map.

= Heroes =

Jungle Toxin
- Now Reveals affected targets.
*Note that this does not grant innate Sight of the target, but simply means that affected targets are detected as though they are not Stealthed.

_______________________________________________

Doctor Repulsor
- Starting Attack Damage changed from 47-57 to 50-54.
- Attack action time reduced from 500ms to 350ms.

Magnetic Contraption
- Cooldown increased from 4 seconds to 10/8/6/4 seconds.
- Cast backswing reduced from 400ms to 300ms.

Opposite Charges
- Mana Cost reduced from 100 to 70/80/90/100.
- Duration reduced from 1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds to 1/1.4/1.8/2.2 seconds.
- No longer applies a Movement Speed Slow to self upon use.

Electric Frenzy
- Now also resets your autoattack cooldown upon using an ability.
- Magic Damage increased from 30/50/70/90 to 40/60/80/100.
- Now grants +50 Attack Speed for the boosted attack (helps make this one attack launch faster).

Ludicrous Speed
- No longer resets your autoattack cooldown upon use (since Electric Frenzy does that now).
- No longer Stunned while travelling.
- Instead, Doctor Repulsor is Perplexed (unable to use items) while travelling.
*This means that Doctor Repulsor can autoattack & cast spells while Ludicrous Speed is active!
*The Perplexed state remains on Doctor Repulsor for 0.8 seconds after exiting Ludicrous Speed.
- Magic Damage dealt per 100 units travelled reduced from 15/20/25 to 6/12/18.
- Max Magic Damage dealt per instance reduced from 300/400/500 to 200/300/400.
- Cooldown increased from 0.3 seconds to 0.4 seconds.



+ Doctor Repulsor has an odd power curve due to the nature of Ludicrous Speed. His laning presence has been virtually non-existent because of his long range ganking potential at level 6, so some raw damage was taken away from Ludicrous Speed, while giving him much better tools for laning & the early game in general.

+ These changes do weaken the raw damage output through his ultimate alone, but the autoattack reset mechanic on Electric Frenzy opens up new combo routes & makes micromanaging his mana pool for Ludicrous Speed even more important. Player mechanical skill in terms of mouse speed & accuracy, cancelling the cast backswing of his abilities, as well as taking advantage of some returning mechanics on Ludicrous Speed will optimize the effectiveness of Doctor Repulsor, while simultaneously retaining options for counterplay (e.g. the Perplex state on Doctor Repulsor means item usage is not immediately available to him after exiting Ludicrous Speed).

+ Overall, these changes favour Doctor Repulsor more in terms of getting that long range ganking power spike at level 6 (which is his unique strength compared to every other hero), without frontloading the power on Ludicrous Speed itself. The changes make him less effective when played as a raw carry if relying on the damage from Ludicrous Speed, and more of a core hero that focuses on capitalizing on the uniqueness of his ganker-carry role and playstyle.
